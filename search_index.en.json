Seawater samples were collected from the global ocean during the Tara Oceans expedition to generate a global ocean reference catalog of genes from planktonic eukaryotes sampled RNA and to explore the expression patterns of community at different microscopic scales with respect to biogeography and environmental conditions.\nRNA sequencing\nThe key step in this technique is to convert RNA fragments into complementary DNA (cDNA library) using a reverse transcriptase. Adapters are then added to each end of the fragments. These adapters contain functional elements which permit sequencing. For example, the amplification element and the primary sequencing site. The cDNA library is then sequenced, producing short sequences called reads which correspond to either one or both ends of the fragment. The depth to which the library is sequenced varies depending on techniques which the output data will be used for.\n1. Nucleic acid extraction\nCryogenic grinding is a very effective technique for taking hard substances, like plant and animal tissues, and turning them into dust. The DNA and RNA can be then extracted simulatenously. Then RNA is purified using a phenol-chloroform extraction method. DNA and RNA are quantified by a fluorometric method.\n2. Library construction\nDeoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment is applied on RNA extractions. To target coding RNA, 3' polyadenylated tail RNA selection is used to limit rRNA quantity. Then RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA because DNA is more stable and to allow for amplification (which uses DNA polymerases). DNA is fragmented by sonification to obtain fragments of a predifined length of 101 bp. The cDNA for each experiment are indexed with a barcode, so that these experiments can be pooled into a single lane for multiplexed sequencing.\n3. Sequencing\nOnce the library is prepared, and adapters added, cDNA library is sequenced on HiSeq instrument with a read length of 101 bp in a paired-end mode.\n\nKey words\nComplementary DNA (cDNA): a DNA synthesized from a RNA molecule (e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA)) in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase.\nLibrary: a pool of DNA fragments with adapters attached. Adapters are designed to interact with the sequencing platform by the surface of the flow-cell (Illumina). A sequencing library can be made by starting from raw genomic DNA or from RNA. In any RNA sequencing library there’s an additional step: the RNA conversion in cDNA. The fragmentation step can be done before or after the cDNA synthesis.\nReads:  a literal sequence generated by the sequencing instrument. The read is ultimately the sequence of a section of a unique fragment from the library. If an RNA is expressed in high copies then there will be more reads coming from it so that reads can be redundant as well.\nMultiplexing: to pool and sequence libraries simultaneously during a single run on sequencing instruments. With multiplex sequencing, individual barcode sequences are added to each DNA fragment during next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation so that each read can be identified and sorted before the final data analysis.\n\nAssembly and gene catalog construction\nEach read sequences are assembled into a contig using VELVET. VELVET is an assembler which takes advantage of De Bruijn graph approach to focus on observed words (or k-mers) among the read sequences. A given k-mer is therefore represented  by a unique node, regardless of how many times it was observed. The costliest part of constructing a de Bruijn graph consists in hashing all the reads, according to a given word length (selected k-mer size is 63 in this study). This operation offers nonetheless an advantageous time complexity compared to a  general pairwise alignment of all the sequences, especially given the high coverage depths encountered. Once all the reads have been hashed, each of their paths are traced along the k-mer nodes, incrementing coverage and creating the appropriate arcs along the way.\nFor each cluster of contig, the longest contig is kept as the representative sequence of the cluster. Sequences were BLASTed against a reference database of known sequences from Prokatyote, mitochondrial and chloroplastic specimens. Sequence with at least 70% identity with the reference database are removed. So that we obtain a catalog of unigenes. In summary a unigene is a complete or partial transcript assembled from metatranscriptomic reads of at least one Tara Oceans station.\nTaxonomic assignment\nTo assign a taxonomic group to each unigene, a reference database is built from UniRef. Sequence similarities between metatranscriptomic gene catalog and reference database is handled by DIAMOND. DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. It allows pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-20,000x speed of BLAST. Taxonomic affiliation uses a weighted lowest common ancestor approach. For each unigene only taxon reference sequences with at least 90% similarity were kept.\nFunctionnal characterization of unigenes\nProtein domain prediction is performed using HMMER. HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for sequence homologs, and for making sequence alignments. Unigenes were seeked in the profile database Pfam. So that a protein domain is assigned to each unigene. Unigenes without assigned protein domain are not kept.\n\nProtein and profile database\nUniProt: the database of protein sequence and functional information, many entries being derived from genome sequencing projects.\nUniGene: partition of sequences into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters. Each UniGene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene, as well as related information such as the tissue types in which the gene has been expressed and map location.\nUniRef: UniProt Reference Clusters provide clustered sets of sequences from UniProt in order to obtain complete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions.\nPfam: the database of protein families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Proteins are generally composed of one or more functional regions, commonly termed domains. Different combinations of domains give rise to the diverse range of proteins found in nature. Pfam entry data are based on UniProt reference proteomes.\n\nExpression and abundance of unigenes\nIn order to estimate the abundance (a proxy of expression) of each unigene in each sample, reads were mapped against the gene catalog. Unigene expression values and genomic occurences are computed in RPKM. Then the abundance of each unigene was normalized and formulated in two different ways.\n\nthe gene abundance relative to the abundance of all genes from the same taxon in percentage.\nthe fraction of the gene abundance attributed to a particular taxonomic group.\n\n\nReads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) is a normalized unit of transcript expression. It scales by transcript length to compensate for the fact that most RNA-seq protocols will generate more sequencing reads from longer RNA molecules\n\nConclusion\nThe global ocean transcript catalog reported here represents a first resource to study extensively and uniformly the gene content of eukaryotes and the dynamics of their expression in the environment.

I provide here some little scripts which will hopefully help to understand the very basics.\n\nThe shell or terminal is a command line interpreter.\nA command is a set of instructions or computer tasks.\nThe interest to work with command line instead of an user graphical interface is to automate a computer task or a complex set of tasks.\nFiles, directories, symbolic links\nThe file or more accurately the name of the file is a pointer. A pointer stores memory address on the hard drive from where the file can be read.\nIt is possible to read, write or execute a file. To do these actions, you need to provide the pointer i.e. the name of the file.\nThe directory is also a pointer but not pointing at a file. Actually the directory point at a list of other pointers. A directory \"contains\" (more accurately \"point at\") files (more accurately \"names of files\"). As a directory is also a pointer, a directory can contain others directories.\nSymbolic links are pointers which are pointing at other pointers. Broadly, they are copies of pointers. To use a symbolic link remains the same as using the name of a file/directory at which it points.\nBrowse files and directories\nChange Directory cd\nTo change the current working directory to a specified one.\nSwitch to the directory root. (This is the last parent directory)\n\nSwitch to the directory home. (This is the directory reserved for the user)\n\nOU\n\nSwitch to the current working directory (This command is useless because you are already working on this directory)\n\nSwitch to the parent directory. (very useful)\n\nSwitch you to the previous directory\n\nPut you in a subdirectory called mon_dossier.\n\nSwitch to the sub-subdirectory called mon_dossier_dans_le_dossier which is in the subdirectory called mon_dossier.\n\nConcept of absolute path and relative path\n\nThe absolute path starts from root, e.g. cd /path/to/my/file\nThe reslative path start from current working directory, e.g. I am at /path/to, i can write: cd ./my/file\n\nFrequently, one begin to use the shell (and even after), most of errors comes from wrong path. (using the relative path is less daunting but more perilous.)\nWhen you type path to a file, speeds up it by using autocompletion with the keypad TAB.\nPrint name of Working Directory pwd\nTo give you the absolute path(i.e. the path from root) of current working directory.\ncommand:\n\noutput:\n\nI'm currently working into the directory  /the/directory/where/i/am\nList ls\nTo give you the list of names of files and directories which are located into the designated directory. (by default, the designated directory is your current working directory)\nCommand for listing files, directories or links into current directory\n\noutput:\n\nTo list files, directories or links into directory called my_dir\n\noutput:\n\nTo display long format list of my_dir content\n\noutput:\n\n-l option displays details of files located into the directory called my_dir.\n-rwxrw-r--\n- rwx rw- r--\n\nThe first character indicates if it's a file (-) or a directory (d) or a link (l)\nr means right to read this file\nw means right to write this file (modify or delete)\nx means right to execute this file\n- means no right\nThey are 3 triplets of characters. Each character indicates if right to read/write/execute is granted or not for respectively the owner-user of this file (first triplet), the owner-group of this file (second triplet) and a foreigner (last triplet).\n\nFor instance here, my file(-) file_into_my_dir.txt can be read and written and executed by the user user (first triplet: rwx) who is the owner of this file. People who belongs to the group teamBI can also read and write but no execute this file (second triplet: rw-) and foreigners can only read the file (last triplet: r--). This file size is 697 bytes. This file was created january the 23th at 11:09.\nSome useful commands\nManual man\nPrint the manual of a shell program\n\n\nPrint manual of the program List ls.\ntype keypad q to quit manual session.\nBrowse the manual using directional keys and up/down pagination arrows keys.\n\nhead\nPrint the first 15 rows of a file.\n\nWill print the first 15 rows of the file mon_fichier into the shell.\ntail\nPrint the last 15 rows of a file.\n\nWill print the last 15 rows of the file mon_fichier into the shell.\nFile viewing more\nTo view the content of a file into the shell. more is especially primitive.\n\nWill show the content of mon_fichier into the shell.\nAdvanced file viewing less\nDisplay the content of a file into a session with more features than more.\n\nWill show the content of mon_fichier into an instance.\n\nType G to go to the end of the file.\nType twice g to got at the beginning of the file.\nUse arrows keys to browse the file upward or downward.\nType / and a word or an expression to seek it. Type n (next) to seek the next occurence of this expression into the file.\nFinally, type q to exit the current less session.\n\nText editor vi\nTo read, write and edit a file a bit like a notepad in windows. They are a lot of text editor under LINUX: my favorite is vi (vim is the improved version), nano is also very popular.\n\nWill load a text editor session to edit mon_fichier. By default, vi only allow you to read a file.\n\nType i to activate the insert mode edition. In this mode, you can modify the text.\nType esc to exit the insert mode. (They are other modes into vi but I will focus only on insert mode this time. vi is actually very rich in options and I show here only basic commands.)\nIn insert mode, vi behaviour is like an editor text.\n\nYou must exit insert mode to execute commands which are not text typing.\n\nOutside insert mode :\n\nTo exit the programn type :q, to force to exit, type :q!\nTo save :w, to force to save :w!\nTo save and exit :wq to force to save and exit :wq!\nTo delete a whole row, type twice d\nTo undo, type u\nTo redo, type ctrl + R\nCommands described in less also works in vi\n\n\n\nNote : if mon_fichier don't exist at the moment I enter the command, then vi will create this file.\necho\nThis command is useful associated with other commands because it returns its input as a text which can be interpreted by the shell.\nTo return a shell string \"coucou\".\n\noutput:\n\nTo return the name of a file mon_fichier as a string.\n\noutput:\n\nConcatenate cat\nTo concatenate files together.\n\nWill show content of mon_fichier into the shell.\nConcatenate 2 files together\nMerge and print contents of mon_fichier1 and mon_fichier2 into the shell.\n\nMerge and print contents of mon_fichier2 and mon_fichier1 into the shell.\n\nWord Count wc\nPrint number of words into a file.\n\nOutput:\n\nWill print the number of rows (newline), number of words and number of characters for the file mon_fichier. Here, mon_fichier counts 1 row, 2 words and 3 characters. (a first word with 1 character and a second word with 2 characters.)\nCount lines for a file\nThe option -l print only the newline counts.\n\nThe mon_fichier counts only one line.\n\nCount words for a file\nThe option -w print only the word counts.\n\nOutput:\n\nCount characters for a file\nThe option -c print only character counts.\n\nOutput:\n\nCombine commands together\nMost of LINUX programs are designed under the principle \"Do one thing and do it well\". For instance, ls print list of files into a directory and wc counts number of newlines or words for an input.\nWe can resume a program as something as basic as:\n\n\nA program proceed an input (text, files, etc.) and return an output (result) as a text, files, etc.\nPower of shell is to give the output of a program as the input of another program and thus to combine both programs together.\n\nFor instance:\n\nouput:\n\nThis command prints a list of 3 files into my current working directory.\nThe Pipe\nNow let's combine 2 programs together using |\n\nouput:\n\n\n\nBy redirecting the output of ls on the input of wc using |, I create a new function: to count the number of files for my current working directory.\n\n\nOutput of ls . was a list of 3 words fichier1 fichier2 fichier3. wc -w prints word counts of the output of ls .. It returns the word counts i.e. file counts.\n\n\nBy redirecting output of programs to input of other programs, we can create new functions.\n\n\nThe pipe | redirect output of a command to the input of the next command. A pipeline in informatics is simply a chain of redirected instructions by pipes.\n\n\nTo write the output of a command (because we want our results written in a file) you have to use &gt;. (By the way, some programs already write their output directly into a file )\n\n\nnote: ; set the end of a command. You can use indifferently newlines or ;.\nFor example:\n\noutput:\n\nI wrote the output of echo inside a file called coucou.txt. Next, I print the content of this file coucou.txt with more.\nLast example of combination of commands\n\noutput :\n\n\noutput :\n\n\noutput :\n\n\nI printed the content of coucou.txt and redirect his output to the input of wc -c which return the character counts for this file coucou.txt. This result has been written in the file nombre_carac_coucou.txt\nNext, I concatenate coucou.txt and nombre_carac_coucou.txt using cat and written output of cat in the file coucou_nombre.txt. I read the file coucou_nombre.txt with more. This file contains a merge of contents of coucou.txt and coucou_nombre.txt.\n\nNote: why 7 characters for \"coucou\" which actually counts 6 characters ?\nWell, it is because the program also counted the jumpline as a character. Indeed, I wrote \"coucou\" but i redirected the output of echo and echo added a new line (it's nicer). So, echo sent to wc the character string coucou\\n (with \\n the jumpline character).\nIf you are a perfectionnist, add the option -n to echo:\n\nThus, echo will not add a jumpline and wc -c will count 6 characters.\nThis is an example to tell you to remain vigilant about your results, and the behavior of your programs. Take the time to understand them well in order to pick the most appropriate program for what you want to do.\nReferences\n\nLearning the bash Shell: Unix Shell Programming\nCameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt\nO'Reilly Media, 1995.

He taught us the method (\"the way\" in Greek) to compose and articulate our thoughts and knowledge. I recently watched a MOOC he recorded for Lycée français international Louis-Massignon. The ability to think analytically and to express ideas is useful. In science, whether in academia or industry, we need to compare different solutions or hypotheses objectively and communicate our analysis to our peers in order to make the best decisions.\n\n\nSpeak One's Mind\nConstructive argumentation is like composition in music. Often, we don't like what we write or say because this is disappointing in regard of the prior efforts, the depth of knowledge we are presenting e.g. a difficult experiment, a thorough state of the art.\nThis disappointment often comes from a lack of methods, and it leads us to fear any form of evaluation: reports, presentations, annual reviews and job interviews. Yet these trials should not be feared but rather seen as opportunities to show our skills, our mastery of knowledge and our ability to articulate information. Everyone should strive to master both knowledge (savoir) and know-how (savoir-faire). Confident in your method, then you have confidence in yourself. After all, an evaluation is meant to show your value. Here is the toolkit to craft any communications based on analysis, whether it be a presentation, a report, or an interview.\nSaying is not Speaking\nTo describe the world, nothing goes without saying. Things must be ordered into a discourse to say the world. Yet saying is not the same as speaking. While both 'saying' and 'speaking' can be oral, 'saying' can also be written. Speaking is a natural ability slowly acquired through imprinting and mimicking. Saying is always about a set of rules, constraints or emphasized injunctions.\nThe world, like ourselves, is alive, and in its impatience creates more disorder than order. To describe and understand the world, we need to put a bit of order to it from time to time. The problem is that we tend to write the way we speak. Speaking gives the illusion of freedom. But this freedom is a mirage. Without order, we cannot articulate ideas and organize complex and technical information. Because the work is too difficult, the writing is limited: the content is approximate; the flow of ideas is disrupted.\nTherefore, to put order in our knowledge is fundamental. It must be done whatever the field. You cannot leave the choice of words, their order, the sentence construction to hazard. Like a body, every element of your words must be articulated, assigned to a specific place, and given a specific role.\nA place for everything, and everything in its place\nThis chiasm shows that in a sentence, the meaning of words matters as much as their order.\n\nTo explain the idea to the reader\nTo show the direction the reader has to follow\n\nThe way to say something changes the interpretation. Some examples to understand:\nPhrasingInterpretation\n\"The French team defeated England.\"Inaccurate as England is a country.\n\"The French team defeated the English team.\"Accurate.\n\"The French team defeated the English team on their home ground.\"Strenghten the merits of the winner.\n\"The French XV defeated the English XV.\"Outdated and wrong expression.\n\"The English team lost against the French team.\"Minimize the French victory.\n\nThere are infinite ways to phrase.\nDepending on the phrasing, one says not the same thing from the same fact. Without even starting to convey an idea, the simple act of reporting a raw fact is enough to create a different reality.\nAn Opinion is not an Analysis\n\n\"Well, opinions are like assholes. Everybody has one.\"\nDirty Harry, The Dead Pool, 1988\n\nExpressing an opinion is different from producing an analysis, because it is not about the content of the thought, but the self. In an opinion I think, the I takes precedence over the think.\nExample:\n\n\"On Saturday, the French Team confirmed the growing strength and confidence of their play.\"\n\nI go beyond the fact to introduce an analysis.\nOn the contrary If I say:\n\n\"The French team dominated a bewildered English team on Saturday, their performance a testament to skill and confidence.\"\n\nI introduce elements of evaluation and judgment that reveal my opinion.\nAll Generalizations are Dangerous, even this One\nThe main error is excessive generalization, which distorts the meaning of what is being said.\nExample:\n\n\"There is a war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe problem with this phrasing is that it creates a sense of normality. Like in There is a sea in Ukraine., indeed, the sea is here, was always here and will likely still be there in the future. Unlike the sea who is a constant, the war is a rupture. Saying there is denies the exceptional nature of the event by treating it as an ordinary occurrence.\nSecond Example:\n\n\"The war was triggered by either the Russians or the Ukrainians.\"\n\nI am taking a side. The term trigger implies an aggressor.\nYet if I want to be factual:\n\n\"The Russian armies attacked Ukraine.\"\n\nHere the difference is that I express a fact instead of an idea.\nTo summary, never use There is. In the world, everything is always the consequence of something else.\nDo not essentialize\nIf I say:\n\n\"The Russian armies attacked Ukraine.\"\n\nIt is different from:\n\n\"The Russians attacked Ukraine.\"\n\nI do a generalization. I am not saying true because not all the Russians attacked Ukraine. Most of the Russians are in their home in Russia. Some of the Russians are worried, some others are in opposition to this war. It is impossible to estimate their number but their existence is enough to do not say The Russians.\n\nDo not attribute fact to a whole nation, population, or category.\nCreate false particularism like To be Russian is a condition to be opposed to Ukraine.\nWeaken your ability to build a constructive argumentation.\n\nMinimize generalization and essentialization.\nHow to do an Analysis?\n\nStatement: Break it into components (Analysis 'to break apart' in Greek). Subject, verb, objects, logical connectors, punctuations. Identify key concepts.\nIdeas: Order ideas from the most relevant to the least in regard of the identified key concepts. Group items of your knowledge according to ideas they support.\nScientific question: More than just turning the statement into an interrogative form. You go beyond the statement by presenting the identified key concepts, the ideas you related to them supported by your knowledge. Starting point of your argument.\nTree of the discourse: Main ideas are the components of the main branch. Secondary ideas are supporting the main branch as leaves. The tree represents the logic you will follow.\nPlan: Name components of branch and leaves. Roadmap to your audience.\n\nDeciphering Words\n\n\"Are the roots of words square?\"\n\"— Square or cubic. It depends.\"\nEugene Ionesco, The Lesson, 1951\n\nIn any statement, you must identify key concepts by describing every components.\nFirst Example of Analysis (History)\n\n\"The second world war, a total war?\"\n\n\n\n? never on random place. Here we interrogate the total war not the world war.\nNotice the singular form. You know that the WWII is plural: war of the totalitarisms, war of the resistances, war of the democracies.\nEach war evolves to become more and more extreme.\n\nThe totalitarisms increase mobilization thanks to their ideology that deshumanizes the enemy.\nThe resistances have a growing level of engagement among members whatever their sex and origins.\nThe democracies initially opposed to the war, progressively adopt elements of the total war.\n\n\n\n\nScientific question: In which way, the different wars in the second world war, totalitarisms, resistances, democracies, are complementary forms of the total war?\nSecond Example of Analysis (Geography)\n\n\"Seas and oceans: spaces at the heart of globalization?\"\n\n\n\nand precises that a sea in not an ocean and reciprocally. and both separates and links the two words.\nDevelop the idea that maritime areas are both anthropized, exploited territories and contested free spaces.\nGlobalization must be explained under this prism of conquest of the seas and the oceans.\nheart is polysemous:\n\nCentrality of the territory.\nMotor or pump of the globalization.\nLoving heart of the globalization. Does it worry about the populations and their environment?\n\n\n\n\nScientific question: In which ways, seas and oceans, two distinct but interconnected maritime areas, can be seen both as territories driving the mondialization and paradoxaly, as the main victims of its secondary effects?\nThird Example of Analysis (Sociology)\n\nHow does the school shape individual life trajectories and contribute to the evolution of society?\n\n\n\nwhich type of society? democracies or authoritarian.\n\nIn democracies: the school's objective of personal fulfilment goes with improvement of the economic efficiency of the society. Despite the gradual restriction of individual choices, they remain at the service of the people.\nIn authoritarian regimes: the state is not at the service of the individual but the individual is at the service of the state. Individual destinies are directed not with concern about personal fulfilment but for the benefit of the society. Society of a state that serves an ideology, or, in the case of illiberal democracy, serves a ruling clique that has confiscated the state.\n\n\nHow does the school shape the evolution of society?\n\nIn China, the non-democratic society assign to school the objective to contribute to the evolution of the society.\nProgress is not evolution.\nSchool is contributing to progress only for the democratic project. The question by using the term evolution covers both democracies and authoriarian regimes.\n\n\nThe capacity of the school as an institution, and of its actors, to achieve objectives, raises the question of resistance or resilience.\n\nResistance is not Resilience. In face of difficulty, resistance fights whereas resilience adapts.\nKnowledge of school objectives, the means and policies used at different historical times.\nDifferent actors mobilized by the educational project. Each actor must assess his level of responsability in the success or the failure of the assigned mission in the educational project.\n\nPierre Bourdieu: responsibility directed by the force of habitus.\nResponsibility  of the institutional body with strong corporatism\nResponsibility  of the political body\n\n\nMichel Foucault's epistemè of modern times: opposition between the democratic ideal for schools and a more pessimistic perspective that sees schools as instruments of coercion rather than education. School as a privileged tool for a control-oriented society.\nSchool as an instrument of social control instead of a dual lever for both education of individuals and evolution of society.\n\n\n\n\nScientific question: Can the educational institution, particularly in democracies, fulfill its dual objectives of individual self-realization and social equalization, as assigned by a democratic society committed to the values of progress?\nLast Example of Analysis (Philosophy)\n\nTo discuss, is it to renounce violence?\n\n\n\nTo produce a discussion through the distorting prism of violence. There is a logical connection this prism weaves between the two poles of the question. This link must be critisized.\nHistoriography organizes the \"living together\". It is a good example of the relationship between discussion and violence.\n\nMichel Foucault links different historical times considering that the human mind remains identical.\nMontaigne considered himself as a guelfe with the gibelins and as gibelin with the guelfes. A way to say that one must always look the world with the eyes of another. Challenge what seems obious. Uncover the foundation of each concept.\n\n\nTwo historiography in opposition:\n\nThe Agora: the society is the place for encountering others, building a social harmony protected by laws. It gathers all discussions.\"\nThe Stasis: codified discussion in order to regulate violence in social relations. How to settle conflicts. Examples: The United Nations (UN); the prosecuting of the war criminals after the WWII in Nuremberg.\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\nCritics of the question itself as it states a \"logical link\" between discussion and violence.\nHow can discussion regulate the violence inherent in all social and political relationships. Limits?\nOn the other hand, instead of reducing violence, does the public expression of thought itself not become a source of violence?\n\nSynthesis:\n\nThe compromise born from the violence of the discussion is the foundation of the City.\nMost schools of thought are formed in opposition to each other: Parmenides against Heraclitus; Socrates and Plato against the Sophists; and so on.\n\n\n\nTo discuss or to discuss?\n\nConclusion\nTo think a discourse is to deconstruct it in order to build one’s own discourse about the world. It is a double task: first unraveling, then reweaving what has been unraveled. This task requires both method and culture.\nCulture is made by learning, by acquisition of knowledge. This is not enough.\nTo acquire a useful culture i.e. a toolbox for analytical thinking, your knowledge must be challenged. By your curiosity which is never a flaw.\nQuestion any new information. Is it useful? What does it teach you about the world?\nOtherwise, a stored but not processed information is useless.\nThis tedious work at the beginning becomes playful once it turns into a reflex through practice. This is a game for one or more players. Engaging in discussion is never wasted time. Through discussion, the work of building culture occurs.\nTo go further\nNicolas Ben Fredj is a social science teacher in Lycée français international Louis-Massignon in Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\n\n    \n    \nMusic suggested to listen while reading this article\n\nRudolf Serkin plays Shubert\nRudolf Serkin, Franz Schubert, Adolf Busch, Hermann Busch\nPiano Trio in E-Flat Major, D. 929 (Op.100) : II.

I wondered whether some models had been trained for use in biology or bioinformatics. I discovered a research project called BioGPT developped by Microsoft. This article to both describe BioGPT and summarise the recent history of Transformers and NLP.\nBibliography is Hard Work (and is getting worse)\nThe PubMed database contains more than 36 million publications. Every year this number increases following an exponential growth.\nThey are no universal glossary e.g. a drug can have multiple synonyms depending on the field, the time frame, the country, etc. So, the research by keyword may be incomplete and not cover all the related articles. In addition, articles are sorted by field or key words making any cross-disciplinary research tedious.\nNatural Language Processing\nNLP are methods to give the computer the ability to understand and speak human language. BioGPT is a model trained on the content of all available articles in PubMed.\nBioGPT can do:\n\nAnswer question using PubMed materials\nFind drugs relations using PubMed materials\n\nHistory of NLP\n\nIn the early 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure establishes human language as a logical structure.\nIn 1952, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley discover neural networks (Nobel Medicine 1963).\n\nThese events inspire the idea of a machine able to speak and understand human language.\nAlan Turing stated that if a machine could chat with you and you can’t tell it apart from a human, then the machine could be considered capable of thinking.\nBoolean request\nBoolean logic involves TRUE or FALSE answer. The found documents are the ones matching an exact term. To go further, you can combine statements OR, AND, NEAR.\nExample: in a search engine, you type \"puppy\" and \"kitten\" to find any documents that contains both \"puppy\" and \"kitten\".\nTerms frequency\n\nTerm frequency: How often appears a word in a document.\nInverse Document frequency: importance of a word in multiple documents.\n\nTerm frequency identifies important word that are both frequent in a document and rare across the dataset. It ignores common words like “the” or “is” as well.\nExample: Tag cloud.\nCo-occurence matrix\nCo-occurence matrix is the table of the number of times two words appear together. The aim is to find words significantly associated. It is possible to reduce a set of words into a set of vector of associated words in order to process vector of words instead of words.\nExample:\n\nApples are green and red.\nRed apples are sweet.\nGreen oranges are sour.\n\n-applesgreenred sweetorangessour\napples212100\ngreen111000\nred 212100\nsweet101100\noranges010011\nsour010011\n\nIn this text, red and apples are associated while sour and apples are not.\nWord2vec: Word to Vector\nA word is considered as a vector. The computer follows an unsupervised learning (~no involved human) from the document. Each surrounding words is a context or bag of words teaching the word to predict given the context. The sum of all predictions produce a vector space or semantic relationship.\nExample:\nThe computer understand from a document that the word queen and king are linked and woman and man relationship are aligned with king and woman relationship. By summing the vectors, the computer can deduce association between queen and woman  and king and man.\n\nNeural Network\nInspired by human brain, they are interconnected neurons organised into layers (input, hidden and output). Each connection between neuron has a weight. The network is trained on documents to adjust weights. Weights are self-corrected to minimise the difference between the prediction and the expected result.\nExample: Word2vec is based on neural network of three layers.\n\nPerceptron\nDesigned in 1969 with the idea of creating a robot in the image of human. The perceptron is a neural network of 2 layers: input and output.\n💡 Note: Without the hidden layer, a neural network is a logistic regression model (Berkson et al. 1944) with a Boolean output.\n\nTransformer\nThe transformer is a neural network with four layers. It adds a a new intermediate layer called attention (Vaswani et al. 2017). The decoder layer transforms the input document into a bag of words. The encoder layer produces a predicted vector of words using word2vec. Attention assigns weights to link the encoder and decoder layers. The transformer is the state-of-the-art method in natural language processing. BERT and GPT are based on transformer.\nExample: deepL for document translation.\nBidirectionnel Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\nTransformer architecture developed by Google in 2018. In France, Martin et al. developed camembert in 2019. The context is processed twice from right to left and from left to right. Pre-trained: the neural network is already weighted based on a training using a HUGE dataset so it can be fine-tuned for specific use.\nExample: Google Search when you type a full sentence.\n\nPeople also ask\n\nGenerative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)\nTransformer architecture developed by openAI in 2020. Contrary to BERT, the document is processed with an unidirectional attention. In addition, the pre-training is different between GPT and BERT. While BERT is trained to predict the missing word giving a context, GPT is trained to generate complete comprehensive sentence giving a context.\nExample: chatGPT\nBioGPT\n\nBioGPT is a GPT model fine-tuned based on PubMed publications.\nMicrosoft provided the source code to build a bioGPT software: github source code BioGPT\nThe  🤗 Hugging Face is an online library of all natural language processing neural network models including transformers including BioGPT.\n\nConclusion\nTransformer models are not trained on human words but on token. Token are the unit of chunks of information extracted from the original document. They are not human readable. Purely black box machine abstraction. Computer language comprehension relies on maths, not&nbsp;on real text comprehension. On the other side, we could say human language comprehension relies on neurotransmitter concentration. The point is the computer and the human are able to understand each other.\nBioGPT is based on biomedical dataset so this is not relevant for other fields yet. For instance if I ask information about the sugar beet to BioGPT, he will give only information related to human nutrition. BioGPT is specialized into biomedical data and nothing else.

The commands would check what partitions there are on each disk and other details like the total size, used up space and file system etc.\nList block devices lsblk\nlsblk lists the different partitions and block devices in the system with their ids.

So error messages always makes my heart beat faster. Hopefully, following the Pareto Principle, 80% of error messages are mild while 20% are the really tough one. The point is to solve the first kind as quickly as possible and effortless. To do so, allow the user to solve the issue by himself with clear messages and hints (in the case of errors related to input files or parameters). Clear presentation of the context and precise localization of the error in the code will save a lot of useless and tedious work to the developer. The time spared on the easy errors just by having better messages, then can be reallocated to the second kind of errors, the troublemakers.\n\n\nThe Ultimate Useless Error Message Ever!\n\nAfter spending a lot of time redesigning my R package error messages, I have developed good practices for writing helpful console error messages in a standardized way using CLI libraries.\nWriting Error Messages\nProblem Statement\n\nExplain exactly what went wrong.\n\n❗ Warning: the program continue running but something might be wrong.\n❌ Alert: The program stopped because they are a critical problem that must be fixed.\n\n\nOnly use one of these two verbs:\n\nmust: the problem is clearly identified.\ncan not: do not know the problem.\n\n\nDo not blame the user. Describe the problem and provide context.\n\nError Location\n\nIndicate where in the code or system an error occurs.\n\nFile name and line number.\nModule and function.\n\n\nThe 🎎 Stack trace is the list of calls leading up to the error. The last call indicate the exact error location.\n\nIt prevents you to search for hours where the bug occurs in your code.\nError Hint\n\nℹ️ Hint: an info bullet to suggest a solution to the user.\nOne bullet = one hint.\n\nExample:\n\n❌ Your name Claude63 must contain only letters.\nℹ️ Check your name does not include numbers.\n\nPunctuation\n\nComplete sentence.\nSingular form.\nA sentence must end with a period.\n\nWhere to Write Error Messages in Code\nFor simple program\nFor a simple script, just write the error message where it happens.\n\nFor complex program\nIn complex program such as an R package (I keep this example but the same logic applies for C, java, python, etc.) writing error messages directly in the code is not good.\n\nThe more complex the program, the harder it becomes to modify error messages and keep them consistent over version and functions.\nError messages are often redundants. Even if your code itself is not repetitive, your messages may be repeated in multiple places. It is harder to stay consistent because you must replicate by hand the same error message over and over in different context.\nLengthy error messages in the middle of your code make it harder to read and review.\n\nThe solution is to make a dictionnary of error messages. In a dedicated file, for instance error_messages.R, write the complete list of error messages and their associated keys. Then in your code, call the needed error message by its key.\n\nerror_messages.R\n\nmain.R\n\nThis way your code is shorter, cleaner and you can change all the error messages in a centralized way.\nCommand Line Interfaces (CLI)\nLast but not least, you need to use a dedicated Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for error messages. Still with the example of R, the package cli provide the tools to build structured messages.\n\nError and warning messages formatting\nGenerate stack track\nText formatting\nHandle variables\nWord pluralizing\n\nError and Warning messages Formatting\nThe following command display a default format for Success, alert, warning, hint type messages. It also automatically generate the stack track to localize the where the error occurs.\n\nStack Track\n\nText Formatting\n\nUsing Variable\n\nPluralize words\n\nDictionnary of error messages combined with cli\n\nerror_messages.R\n\nmain.R\n\nCLI Libraries in Other Languages\n\nPython: Click\nC++: fmt\nPhp: Symfony CLI\nJava: Picocli\n\nConclusion\n\nUse short and consistent style and format.\nTrace back and description of context is mandatory.\nUse a dictionnary of error messages to centralize them and lighten your code.\nUse CLI libraries to help you write formatted and standardized error messages.\n\nReferences\n\nR package cli: r-lib/cli\nDocumentation: R package cli doc\n\n","id":"https://guerinpe.com/articles/error-messages/","title":"Error Messages with a CLI"},"https://guerinpe.com/articles/ethymologicon-of-science/":{"body":"Scientific terms are largely of Greco-Latin origin.

Aristotle, one of the Plato's student, left the Academia after twenty years to become the tutor of Alexander the Great for three years. Upon his return to Athens, Aristotle founded his own school: the Lyceus. The followers of Aristotle and his school where known as Peripatetics named after the practice of walking while teaching. The Lyceus brought together teaching and research across many fields. Their method was to collect and classify knowledge and observations concerning the questions at hand before engaging in theoretical work. A practice similar to the state of the art in modern research.

This is an important instrument for the preservation of species. This first map is published in the journal Nature Communications. As I have done all the bioinformatics analysis, I thought I could present this work from my point of view as a computer scientist. Indeed, this work required the collaboration of a wide range of professions: ecologist, oceanographer, statistician and geneticist.\n\n *Team \"Biogéographie des Vertébrés\" Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes from UMR CNRS \"Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive\" in collaboration with IFREMER  and ETH Zurich\n\n\nCet article est publié en version française sur Bioinfo-fr.net\n\nGenetic diversity ?\nIn the context of our study, genetic diversity is the variety of genes within a single species. Influenced by disease, living space or climate change, this factor is likely to decrease faster than the diversity between species. Of course, this is a definition of the subject of our study, but the issue here was to measure our magnitude (genetic diversity). In order to do this we compared the gene sequences of different individuals within the same species. From a sequence alignment it is possible to calculate the nucleotide diversity ${\\Pi}$ described by Nei and Li in 1979. This measure specifies the average distance (the number of different nucleotides) between each pair of sequence pair comparisons.\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \\frac{k_{ij}}{m_{ij}}\n$$\n\n\nWhere ${n}$ the number of sequences\nWhere ${\\binom{n}{2}}$ the number of pairs of two sequences to compare\nWhere ${k_{ij}}$ the number of nucleotides which differs between the sequences ${i}$ and ${j}$\nWhere ${m_{ij}}$ the number of shared nucleotides between the sequences ${i}$ and ${j}$\n\n\nBarcode of Life\nRecent years have seen the emergence of large public databases containing the DNA sequences of several million individuals of different species from thousands of scientific studies around the world. One of these databases is the BOLD (Barcode of Life), which gathers produced, reported and annotated DNA barcodes from hundreds of scientific missions. DNA barcodes are DNA sequences which are characteristic of the species. These sequences allow rapid and reliable identification of the individual to its species. In the case of the BOLD project, the DNA barcode corresponds to the sequence of a mitochondrial gene such as Cytochrome Oxidase I. Since mitochondria are not subject to selection forces unlike their host cells, differences in mitochondrial DNA sequences observed between different individuals or species result from genetic drift alone. It is therefore possible to use these mitochondrial DNA sequences, judiciously named DNA barcodes, as identifiers of the species or even the individual. The particular interest of BOLD is to provide a large number of geo-referenced DNA barcodes. It is then possible to calculate not only the intraspecific genetic diversity but also its geographical distribution. By coupling these two features we have generated a map of genetic diversity.\n\nKey words\nBiodiversity: the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.\nDNA barcode: a DNA sequence of a gene or part of a gene. First, a DNA barcode must be sufficiently conserved between organisms to be able to compare distant organisms. Second, a DNA barcode must be sufficiently variable to be able to identify a genus or even a species or an individual.\nSpecies diversity: number of different species recorded in a given environment\nGenetic diversity: degree of variety of genes within a species. In this study it is estimated from DNA barcodes as the probability that a nucleotide differs between two sequences of individuals taken at random within the same species in a given environment.\n\n\nThe distribution of fish genetic diversity on a global scale is unevenly distributed\nI assembled a database of more than 70,000 geo-referenced mitochondrial DNA sequences belonging to 3,815 species of marine fish and 1,611 species of freshwater fish. These data made it possible to estimate the average genetic diversity in cells with a resolution of 200 km. The analysis showed that the genetic diversity of marine and freshwater species was heterogeneously distributed throughout the world. The 10 % of cells with the highest genetic richness (hot spots) are located in the Western Pacific, Northern Indian Ocean and Caribbean Seas for marine species, while they are located in South America for freshwater species. By studying the environmental factors specific to each cell (more than fifty), we have established that the genetic diversity of marine species increases with temperature (and the factors that are positively correlated with it, such as latitude, or negatively correlated with it, such as oxygen concentration, for example), whereas the genetic diversity of freshwater fish is mainly influenced by the complexity of the habitat and the ancient history of the region.\nSpecies diversity is not really correlated with genetic diversity in the case of fish.\nFinally, we investigated whether there was a correlation between species diversity, i.e. the number of species after the scarcity of counts, and intraspecific genetic diversity. This correlation is very weak, suggesting that regions with the greatest genetic diversity are not necessarily regions with the greatest species diversity.\n \nClassification of cells depending simultaneously of their values of genetic and species diversity for marine (a) and freshwater (c) species. Values of diversity were reported on the global map using a colour gradient depending on the values of the genetic and species diversities for marine species (b) and freshwater species (d) respectively. The colour scale of Fig. 2a–d is defined in the Fig. 2d. The line was represented as the output of a linear model (lm) of the correlation between genetic diversity and species diversity. Person coefficient of correlations calculated in linear regressions (r) are reported on the figure. Drawn with R version 3.2.3.\nConclusion\nBy identifying the hot spots of genetic diversity, this map should help to take more appropriate protection measures. Indeed, the more diverse a population is, the better it will be able to adapt to changes in its environment. The genetic diversity aspect should therefore be considered separately from the species diversity aspect. This implies further conservation developments. These efforts will perhaps be achieved with the new objective, advocated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, of protecting 30% of ocean and land surfaces by 2030 .\nIn order to ease the access of the map, I realised an interactive map of fish genetic diversity as a web application: https://shiny.cefe.cnrs.fr/wfgd/\n \nThe application \"Worldmap of Fish Genetic Diversity\" allows visualisation of the  distribution of the genetic diversity of marine and freshwater fish species on a world map.\nCodes source\n\nStatistical analysis: https://github.com/Grelot/global_fish_genetic_diversity\nWeb Shiny Application: https://gitlab.mbb.univ-montp2.fr/reservebenefit/webapp_marine_worldmap_bold\n\nReferences and notes\n\nGlobal determinants of freshwater and marine fish genetic diversity\nStephanie Manel, Pierre-Edouard Guerin, David Mouillot, Simon Blanchet, Laure Velez, Camille Albouy &amp; Loic Pellissier\nNature communications. 2020 Feb 10.

Their aim is to industrialize scientific discovery to increase the pace of innovation for military applications. From that point on, the figure of the lonesome wizard in his ivory tower gives way to the salaryman working within a team, a laboratory and an Institute. The Research Unit was born.\nIn this modern structure, science evolves into a collective and standardized activity. The laboratory is no longer a cabinet of wonders or a private workshop, like those of Lavoisier or Newton. Instead, it becomes a production unit organized around teams, stakeholders, deliverables and measured outcomes.\nInstitutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) or the Los Alamos National Laboratory, created for the Manhattan Project, symbolize this transformation. In France, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) is created in 1939.\nIn this modern area, the successful scientist is, above all, a productive one. But what does productivity mean in science? Peer-reviewed publications in scientific journal. The more you publish, the more visible and fundable you become. In 1942, the sociologist Logan Wilson coins the mantra Publish or Perish, capturing the pressure on academics to continually produce papers. Later, in 1962, Eugene Garfield introduces the metrics to evaluate journal and indirectly their authors: the Impact Factor.\nDefinition\nThe Impact Factor (IF) of a scientific review is given by the ratio of number of citations divided by the number of issues in the last two years.\n$$\n\\text{IF} = \\frac{n_{\\text{citations}}}{n_{\\text{publications}}}\n$$\n\n$n_{\\text{citations}}$ the number of citations in the current year to items published in the previous 2 years\n$n_{\\text{citations}}$ the number of substantive articles and reviews published in the same 2 years\n\nNote: self-citations within the same review are considered as citations as well.\nWhat is a good Impact Factor?\n\n&gt; 10 is excellent.\n&gt; 5 is awesome.\n&gt; 2 is good.\nAny scientific work is respectable.\n\nKeep in mind that Impact Factor depends mostly on the considered field. IF reflects the pace and volume of publishing in a field. In Physics for instance, the pace of publications is slower than in Medicine. So, the IF in Physics will always be lower than in Medicine as they are less publications.\nThe language matters a lot. English is the lingua franca of science. As a result, any publications that are not written in english will have a low Impact Factor.\nThe choice of key words to spin the publications is not neutral. Using emerging and hot terms e.g. machine learning will boost the visibility of the publications, then its citation rate, then the Impact Factor of the journal. Many scientists reframe their writting to fit trends and increase their IF.\nLast but not least, publishing is a competition and the performance is the Impact Factor. In consequences, institutions adopt publication strategy to optimize their metrics. The Impact Factor of a journal can also be indirectly influenced by the institutional affiliation of its authors.\nWhy does Impact Factor matter?\n\nAcademic legitimacy: Publishing in a high Impact Factor journal is considered a mark of research quality and visibility.\nCareer: Performance of a scientist is measured with the Impact Factor of the journals where they publish. This also influences rankings on academic platform like ResearchGate.\nRanking of your Institution: Performance of University is measured with the Impact Factor of the publications produced by its affiliated scientists. The Shangai Ranking is the most important global university ranking.

Recently, progress in sequencing technologies made it possible to refine this understanding through genomics. Understanding and describing populations of living organisms in a given environment by exploiting sequencing data is the ultimate goal of landscape genomics. So this article is an introduction of this field.\n \n\n\nCet article est publié en version française sur Bioinfo-fr.net\n\n« Landscape genomics » sounds like a work by Eduardo Kac. This somewhat post-modern term actually refers to a scientific field that has expanded over the past decade.\nPopulations : an ambiguous definition\nIndividuals from a same species, unless they are clones, are all slightly differents from each others. In breeding conditions where parents and genotypes are known, it is possible to idendificate accurately relationships between genetic diversity and phenotype. However, in other conditions where these information about pedigree are not available (for instance a study about a wild species with few related information) so it is necessary to infer this genetic structure.\nIndeed, a species - let's take the example of an animal species - can be composed of several populations.\nSpeaking of populations, two very thorough researchers, Oscar Gaggiotti &amp; Robin Waples, have listed 17 very exact definitions of this concept. The two authors concluded that with so many definitions for the same concept, based on the same observations, different researchers could reach different or even contradictory results. What is a population? There is no correct answer, the definition depends on the context. In the context of landscape genomics, a population is a group of individuals of the same species capable of interacting at the time of reproduction. A population is therefore defined according to spatial, genetic and temporal criteria. Indeed, not all individuals will have the opportunity to interbreed due to geographic distance, habitat heterogeneity or other factors.\nHardy and Weinberg defined the equilibrium state of an ideal population in which genetic diversity would tend towards a constant value. The conditions necessary for such an equilibrium are:\n\nThe absence of mutations to prevent the introduction of new alleles\nPanmixie, a scholarly word meaning equal opportunity for access to reproduction\nGenerations do not overlap\nThere's no natural selection\nThere is no transfer of genetic variants to a population from another\n\nIn reality, the ideal population does not exist, but the knowledge of this theoretical equilibrium state of a population's genetic diversity makes it possible to determine the effects of external factors on a real population's genetic diversity. In other words, the way in which a population is not ideal unravels how the natural habitat affects the genetic structure of this population.\nThreatened populations in their habitat\nIn my choice of animal species, I pick up a fish, for instance the red mullet (Mullus surmuletus). As we have seen, in the state of Hardy and Weinberg, the populations are undisturbed and extend infinitely. In the real world, fish stocks are declining and the size of individuals is decreasing.\nWhile numbers of individuals or morphology can give us trends in the characteristics of a species at a given location, it is difficult to identify multiple populations and the interchanges between them. The transfer of genetic variants from one population to another is called gene flow. If there is gene flow between populations and individuals from one population acquires adaptive traits then individuals from other populations are likely to acquire that adaptation as well.\nThe appearance or disappearance of gene flows, the acquisition or loss of adaptive traits are processes related to the species habitat. A knowledge of the habitat and geographical distribution of individuals is therefore necessary. To understand and describe these processes of gene flow and adaptation in relation to the geography and nature of the habitat is therefore to understand the population structure of a species and the way in which the habitat (the landscape) contributes to this structure. To understand how habitat structures the genetics of a species populations. It means making informed decisions in terms of conservation policy.\nFrom geography to genomics: a bit of history\nThe possibilities offered by next generation DNA sequencing combined with new statistical approaches (in particular Bayesian) exploiting the power of computing clusters has allowed the emergence of a science between population genetics and landscape ecology: landscape genetics, which now tends to be called landscape genomics because of the systematic use of full or reduced genome sequencing data in recent studies.\nThis discipline has its origins in the work of botanist Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (1778-1841) and naturalist geographer Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913). De Candolle was the first to observe that the spatial distribution of individuals within a species is determined by physical causes or resources. Similarly, during a travel in the Malaysian archipelago, Wallace noticed a physical 'boundary' separating the fauna between Australia and the eastern region.\nThis approach gives the spatial mapping of the allelic frequencies observed in one or several species or populations. Subsequently, it then becomes possible to study possible correlations between landscape characteristics and this distribution. For a long time this approach has been limited by the number of genetic or molecular markers available (parasitic fauna associated with individuals, faecal composition, microsatellite DNA...). It was then difficult to obtain genetic data on several populations on a spatial scale.\nToday, with computer technology, it is possible both to process complex geographical maps of very numerous environmental descriptors with high resolution and at the same time to process tens of thousands of genetic variants among the populations studied. With the emergence of new high-throughput sequencing technologies and the increasingly urgent problems of conservation, landscape genetics is thus experiencing renewed and growing interest.\nI'm not trying to present all aspects of landscape genomics, I will simply describe the role that bioinformatics plays in it through the point of view of a bioinformatician.\nA case study in landscape genomics\nOur example\nLet's imagine that we have a fish species with two distinct observed phenotypes (red and blue) and we want to know if there are several genetic populations of this species and if the distribution of individuals within a population is structured by environmental factors.\n\nData\nWe need to collect two types of data for each individual:\n\nEnvironmental descriptors: temperature, bathymetry, substrate, phytoplankton production, current measurement, distance to shore... These data can be retrieved from the GPS coordinates of the individuals on specialized databases such as the Global Marine Environment Datasets.\nGenotypes are more expensive to obtain. It is necessary to sample each individual, extract their DNA and sequence them. Although the cost of high-throughput genome sequencing has steadily decreased over the past 15 years, it is still too high for large-scale analyses involving the sequencing of hundreds of individuals. This is why reduced genome sequencing is prefered.\n\nDNA sequencing\nOne method for sequencing reduced genomes is RAD-seq for Restriction site Associated Dna SEQuencing. The individual's DNA is extracted and then digested by a restriction enzyme. A sequence called an adapter sequence to initiate sequencing is then incorporated at the digested ends with a tag sequence that will identify the individual. Thus during sequencing, only the consecutive regions of the restriction sites are sequenced. Depending on the enzyme used and the species studied, the number of restriction sites may vary. It is necessary to choose an enzyme that generates a number of fragments that is neither too high (if there are too many sites to sequence, the coverage will be low and there will be missing data for each individual which prevents the comparison of genotypes between individuals) nor too low (if there are not enough sites, there will not be enough genetic markers and it will not be possible to distinguish genetic structures within populations). If a reference sequence of the genome of the species studied is available or in the absence of a close species, it is possible to carry out simulations of enzymatic digestion of the genome in order to choose the most relevant enzyme (see the simRAD package available under R).\nProcessing of sequencing data\nAnother aspect of our work will be the processing of this RAD-seq data. This is a classic FastQ file. The first step will be to clean these data by removing the bad quality sequences or contaminations (phiX, adapters, PCR clone...). For the second step, it will be a question of demultiplexing, i.e. from the reading of the tag sequences incorporated in the sequencing, assigning each sequence to an individual.\nGenotyping\nThen comes the crucial step of calling the variants. This involves grouping together all the sequences of the same enzymatic site for all the individuals in order to deduce from the frequencies of each type of base at each position of the sequence, whether the individual is homozygous to the reference, heterozygous or alternatively homozygous. For each enzyme site, genetic variants are sought among the individuals and a genotype is assigned to each individual.\nThere are two popular methods for processing this RAD-seq data: STACKS and freebayes.\n\n\nAs the name implies STACKS creates stacks of sequences in order to search for individual variations. STACKS has the advantage of being a rigorous and robust method but requires good average coverage of sites per individual and that the sequences must be of identical size (it is therefore not possible to trimm sequences where only the 3' tail is of poor quality during the cleaning step). It is therefore a suitable method if your data is of good quality.\n\n\nFreebayes (dDocent) is based on the concept of genome reference sequence locus rather than sequence stacking and uses a Bayesian approach to assign a genotype knowing the sequences observed at the locus in question. It is therefore possible to use trimmed sequences and genotype an individual even with low coverage where STACKS would have produced only missing data.\n\n\nPopulation assignment\nIndividual genotypes can be retrieved as a VCF file. Software such as STRUCTURE or ADMIXTURE allows, using a hierarchical clustering approach, to perform a population assignment test for each individual based on the genotypes. The allelic frequencies observed for each locus make it possible to infer genetic populations to which individuals are assigned according to their alleles. Each iteration of this operation makes it possible to refine the assignment. The final result is a probability of belonging to one or more genetic populations for each individual.\nAnalysis of populations in relation to environmental descriptors\nBy combining population assignments to environmental descriptors, we can then look for correlations between environmental factors and the genetic structure of our observed populations. For example, goldfish, located at the pond level, live in warm water with low salinity while blue fish, located at the seashore, live in cold water with high salinity. The two populations are only connected by a grau (estuary in Occitan). Differences in environmental conditions and the relative isolation of the two populations may explain the genetic differences observed between the two populations (red and blue). So the landscape structures the genetics of the species.\n\nIf you are interested in a real case study of landscape genomics in a marine environment, then I recommend Laura Benestan's article on American lobster in Canada.\nIf you don't like the sea and have a preference for plants, then I recommend Jimena Guerrero's article on truncated alfalfa in the Mediterranean.\n\nConclusion\nLandscape genomics is a discipline that integrates concepts and tools to test the effect of landscape on individual dispersal and gene flow. It is used to estimate the adaptive capacity of individuals to changes in their environment. We have seen that bioinformatics brings power to these methods at the crossroads between ecology, statistics, computer science and genomics. These approaches are useful both for research laboratories and design offices. The numerous landscape genomics studies carried out during this decade have contributed to making informed choices for nature conservation policy. This has made it possible to maintain ecosystems and to prevent or correct any degradation they may suffer.\n\nCurrently in the western Mediterranean sea, the RESERVEBENEFIT project aims to assess the connection between marine protected areas. This assessment is based on a landscape genomics approach and aims ultimately at optimizing the placement of future marine protected areas in the Mediterranean sea in order to sustain fish stocks. The fruits of this work, a collaboration between fishermen and scientists for which I have the honor of carrying out the bioinformatics part, are disseminated on a dedicated twitter account.\nReferences\n\nLandscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics\nStephanie Manel, Michael Schwartz, Gordon Luikart, Pierre Taberlet\nTrends in ecology &amp; evolution. 2003 Apr 27.

I did a state of the Art of available methods and developed serveral workflows to process and manage metabarcoding data from the Monaco Marine Scientific Exploration.\n\n\n\nCet article est publié en version française sur Bioinfo-fr.net\n\nOverview: the necessity to assess marine biodiversity\nMarine environments, both coastal and offshore, are being severely impacted by traditional and emerging human activities. This is translated into habitat losses, pollution and overexploitation which treats marine biodiversity. It compromises the sustainability of marine ecosystems and services. As a response to the environmental degradation, initiatives aims to protect marine ecosystems. Development of reliable marine biodiversity assessment methods is necessary. One of the most promising genetic techniques for improving biodiversity assessments is the metabarcoding of environmental DNA.\nWhat is metabarcoding ?\nShort history of molecular identification\nOriginally, microbiologists identified bacteria by observing their morphological characteristics, for example under the microscope. In 1965, Zuckekandl and Pauling proposed to use DNA sequences as a molecular marker of evolution. However, DNA sequencing techniques only appeared in 1970 with the Sanger method.\nIn 1983, Mullis et al. invented the polymerase chain reaction, which allows DNA material to be amplified in vitro. This method of molecular biology revolutionized the field of microbiology because it allows to target by amplification a specific DNA marker at the ribosomal gene level. It allows to identify the species present in a sample from their DNA molecules.\nEarly taxonomic barcodes\nIn the early 2000s, ecologists became interested in these molecular biology methods of amplifying DNA-type molecular markers. Paul Herbert was the first to talk about DNA barcoding. He recommends the use of a standardized molecular marker, allowing the identification of all the species of the living orders, exactly like a supermarket barcode.\nThe first DNA barcode is a 658-base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial gene for the Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) subunit. Each vertebrate species is identifiable by its COI DNA sequence. To systematically list all COI barcodes, the Barcode of Life scientific consortium was created in 2004. In 2007, the world database of DNA barcodes is published. The Barcode Of Life Data System now has millions of species listed with their DNA barcodes from thousands of scientific projects around the world.\nThe chloroplast markers RBCL (Ribulose Biphosphate CarboxyLase; 553 base pairs) and MATK (MATurase K; 879 base pairs) are designated as standard markers for plants in 2009. In 2012, fungi have their own standard barcode the internal transcribed spacer (ITS; 450 base pairs). For bacteria the 16S ribosomal marker is mainly used although there are no recognized standard markers.\nEnvironmental DNA\nWe know that all living organisms shed and disperse pieces of skin or scales into their environment. The DNA material contained in and around cells of these tissues then persists for several days in the environment. Eukaryotic cells have mitochondria, an organelle that is the seat of cellular respiration, which is essential for metabolism. Each cell has 300 to 1000 mitochondria. The mitochondrion has its own DNA distinct from the nuclear DNA of the cell. Copies of mitochondrial genes are therefore much more abundant than nuclear genes in the environment. In general, it is these genes that are selected as barcodes for barcoding.\nFrom barcoding to metabarcoding\nBarcoding is a method of species identification that uses a DNA sequence from one or more specific genes. Just as supermarket barcodes identify products, certain DNA sequences i.e DNA barcodes identify species or even individuals. Different regions of genes are used to identify different groups of organisms with the help of barcodes.\nWhile barcoding is applied to a targeted species in a given environment, metabarcoding is a method that targets all barcode sequences captured in a given environment. The sequencing of all the barcodes in the environment or metabarcode is made possible by high-throughput sequencing methods such as the illumina sequencer. Indeed, thanks to the metabarcode, it becomes possible to detect almost all the organisms present in a sample from a complex environment.\nMaterials and methods\nHigh-throughput sequencing methods make it possible to rapidly obtain hundreds of millions of metabarcodes from a complex environment. From this information, it becomes possible to measure the biodiversity in the environment. Indeed, almost all organisms present in the environment are detected.\n\nSampling and environmental DNA capture\nTo begin, samples are taken from the sea. They are done by filtering the water through a system of pumps and filtration. One of the fundamental steps in preparing for filtration is sterilization and limiting contamination of the material. The DNA filter is connected to a pump that brings up the sea water. The transect starts according to a pre-established sampling plan by following a coastline over a given navigation time. In order to preserve the DNA collected during filtration, the filter is filled with a buffer solution. The samples containing the DNA are then received by the laboratory in sterile conditions where it can be amplified and sequenced.\n\nDNA replication errors can occur during PCR. The error rate of the sequencing is nevertheless quite low. Finally, it is possible to sequence the fragments by their two ends to increase the accuracy of the sequencing. This method is called paired-end sequencing.\nBioinformatics workflow\nProgramming for bioinformatics processing is done using a workflow manager. The advantages are numerous: good development practices, parallelization, virtualization, increased portability on cluster as well as on cloud and scientific reproducibility.

In addition, although the error rate of sequencing is low, the DNA reads from sequencing are not yet reliable enough for species identification. Complementary reads of the same DNA fragment are assembled. Thus, the complete sequence of the barcode is reconstructed while increasing the reliability of the read sequence.\nDemultiplexing\nDNA sequences from the different samples are mixed together. Demultiplexing consists in reassigning each read DNA sequence to its original sample. To identify the original sample of a given read sequence, a short DNA fragment called a tag has been incorporated before the sequencing. Simply identify the tag on the sequence to find its original sample. If a sequence does not have a tag at this step, then it is removed from the study.\nClustering and Denoising\nIdentical sequences are grouped and counted for each sample. Some sequences differ by only a few bases between them. Indeed, during the amplification of the DNA fragments that precedes the sequencing, mutations occur randomly on some copies. At the end of sequencing, many sequences are actually erroneous versions of the original sequence. To eliminate amplification noise, algorithms are used to group similar sequences together. Relative abundance is used to distinguish the original sequence from its noise.\nTaxonomic assignment\nThis step requires a reference database i.e. a list of barcode sequences corresponding to known species. If a sequence aligns with a reference, its assignment in the tree of life is obtained using the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) taxonomy. If a sequence aligns with more than one reference, the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm is applied. The LCA searches for the last common node of the phylogenetic tree from which the branches of each of the involved reference lines diverge. The LCA thus assigns the sequence to the last common ancestor. Finally, each barcode of each sample is assigned to a taxon. This results in a list of taxa present in the different environmental samples.\nAnalysis and Applications: an example of fish in the marine environment\nEmilie Boulanger et al. studied fish in 6 marine protected areas in the Mediterranean sea and their adjacent fishing areas using environmental DNA (eDNA). Analysis of eDNA metabarcoding data reveals that there are fewer fish species in marine reserves than in adjacent fishing areas. Indeed, the gradient in species richness is accompanied by a marked change in fish species composition under different management. This dissimilarity is mainly due to species that are often overlooked by conventional visual surveys but detected by eDNA: crypto-benthic, pelagic and rare fish. These results do not negate the importance of reserves in protecting biodiversity, but provide new insight into how underrepresented species groups can respond positively to fishing pressure and how conservation efforts can shape regional biodiversity patterns.\nTo go further\nLola Romant has made a beautiful documentary about marine eDNA metabarcoding methods and their applications in the Mediterranean sea.\n\n    \n    \nReferences\n\nMolecules as documents of evolutionary history\nEmile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling\nJournal of theoretical biology. 1965.

You want to visualize on a 2D graph the similarity (or dissimilarity) of the performances of the different runners. Multi Dimensional Scaling is a method to compute coordinates for each item in a chosen number of dimensions (usually 2D) so that the distances between points match the dissimilarities between items as closely as possible.\n\nIn other word we calculate for each ${\\binom{10}{2} = 45}$ pairs of runners, a distance or dissimilarity based on their results on each race. The results are stored in a dissimilarity matrix.\nThese distances are then computed using a stress function that minimize the difference between interpoint distance on the graph and the actual  distance calculated in the dissimilarity matrix.\nWe plot the 2D coordinates: runners with similar performance end up close and those with different performance end up far. Note that MDS can also be used on greater dimension (3D, 4D, ...).\n\nLet's calculate Euclidian distance for our dissimilarity matrix:\n$$\n\\text{Euclidean Distance}(v, w) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (v_i - w_i)^2}\n$$\n\n${(v, w)}$ pair of two items ${v}$ and ${w}$ (e.g two runners we compare)\n${i}$ the values to compare (e.g the measured performance ${v_i}$ and ${w_i}$ for runners ${v}$ and ${w}$ for the race ${i}$)\n\nThen MDS minimize the calculated distances for each pair in order to plot them together on a 2D graph:\n\nGiven distances ${d_{ij}}$ between any runners ${i}$ and ${j}$\nFind positions ${(x_{ij}, y_{ij})}$\nWith 2D space ${k = 2}$\nThat minimize a stress function\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{k=2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} (|x_{ik}-x_{jk}| - d_{ij})^2\n$$\n⚠️ When the dissimilarities are Euclidean distances, MDS gives the same coordinates of points as PCA. This is because minimizing the Euclidean distances between points is equivalent to maximizing their linear correlations.\nThere are all distances you can compute with rdist in R:\nManhattan distance\n$$\nd(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1} |x_i - y_i|\n$$\n\nCounts the total absolute differences.\nUseful when you care about additive differences e.g distance between genotypes\n\nCanberra distance\n$$\nd(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1} \\frac{|x_i - y_i|}{|x_i| + |y_i|}\n$$\n\nNormalizes the difference by the magnitude of the values.\nSensitive to small change near zero\nUseful for data with many zeros e.g. allele frequencies in populations.\n\nBinary distance (Jaccard)\n$$\nd(x,y) = \\frac{r + s}{q + r + s}\n$$\n\n\nWhere ${q}$ number of cases where ${(x = 1 ; y = 1)}$\nWhere ${r}$ number of cases where ${(x = 1 ; y = 0)}$\nWhere ${s}$ number of cases where ${(x = 0 ; y = 1)}$\n\n\n\nMeasure dissimilarity between presence/absence data\nIgnore absence/absence case\nUseful for presence/absence data e.g. grid of regions with observed species or not within\n\nMaximum distance (Chebyshev)\n$$\nd(x,y) = \\max_{i} |x_i - y_i|\n$$\n\nOnly capture largest single difference\nUseful if the worst-case difference dominates e.g. nucleotide pair read quality control\n\nExample of distance between genotypes\nData set\nWe work on a collection of 10 tetraploid genotypes and 10,000 SNPs.

Here our vectors are genotypes observed on 10,000 SNPs. We use Manhattan measure to compute distances between genotypes. We observe 5 classes of genotypes 0,1,2,3,4. For a given pair ${(v, w)}$ of observed genotypes ${i}$, the maximum distance is 4 - 0 = 4 and the minimum distance is 0.\n$$\n\\text{Manathan Distance}:  \\sum_{i} |v_i - w_i|\n$$\nAs we cannot process missing data, we remove SNPs with missing calls so that we keep 9,000/10,000 SNPs to generate the dissimilarity matrix.\nIn R, you need rdist function from the rdist R package to compute pairwise distances.\n\nThis is a plot of the pairwise manhattan distance between genotypes. The lighter the greater the distance.\n\nMulti dimensional scaling\nWe want to visualize genotypes distance in the dissimilarity matrices as a set of geometry points. Here the\nterm distance is standing for measure of dissimilarity. We want to project our manhattan distances in an\neuclidian space of 2 dimensions.

They are distributed as an open source software available on the following website: http://metabarcoding.org/obitools.\nData description: a bit of biology\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic information for development of all living organisms.\n\nDNA molecules are composed of four nucleotides:\n\nthymine (T)\nadenine (A)\ncytosine (C)\nguanine (G)\n\n\nThymine and adenine are complementary: T==A\nCytosine and guanine are complementary: C==G\nEach strand of the double helix can be described as a sequence of nucleotides (e.g. ATTCGCT)\nOne strand is the reversed complementary version of the second one (e.g. AGCGAAT is the reverse complementary sequence of ATTCGCT)\nSense of a DNA strand can be:\n\npositive (+) \"sense strand\" from 5' to 3'\nnegative (-) \"antisense strand\" from 3' to 5'\n\n\nThe 5'-end designates the end of the DNA strand that has the fifth carbon in the sugar-ring of the deoxyribose or ribose at its terminus.\nThe 3'-end designates the end of the DNA strand that has the hydroxyl group of the third carbon in the sugar-ring free, and is known as the tail end.\n\nBy convention, we write and read a DNA sequence from 5' to 3'. To describe a whole DNA molecule, we write the sequence of the positive sense strand (the negative antisense strand sequence can be deduced from the positive sense sequence as it is the reverse complementary).\nMetabarcoding context\nDetermining the order of the nucleotides composing a DNA molecule is known as DNA sequencing. In metabarcoding context we want to target barcode sequence exclusively. Barcode are DNA sequence of gene from mitochondrion with the following property:\n\nThe conservative region is typical of the taxonomic group we want to target (e.g. teleostei). The conservative region will be used as primer to initiate the PCR. The hypervariable region is the barcode sequence itself, it permits to identify at species level. In metabarcoding, barcode sequences from a sample are targeted and ampliflied by PCR using primer. Then the isolated DNA barcodes are pooled with barcode sequences from other samples. A tag sequence of 8 nucleotides is added to each DNA fragments from a given sample. So that it will be possible to assign the sample of a given DNA fragment in downstream analysis.\nNext generation sequencing\nDNA sequencing is performed on the library of amplified DNA barcodes. The sequencing of illumina instrument is paired-end. Adaptors are annealed to the ends of DNA fragments. Fragments bind to primer-loaded flow cell and bridge PCR reactions amplify each bound fragment to produce clusters of fragments. During each sequencing cycle, one fluorophore attached nucleotide is added to the growing strands. Laser excites the fluorophores in all the fragments that are being sequenced and an optic scanner collects the signals from each fragment cluster. Then the sequencing terminator is removed and the next sequencing cycle starts.\nThe NGS technique produces millions of short sequences (typical read length of 125 bp)\n\nFASTA files\nFor FAST Alignment. Universal format to describe DNA sequences.\n\n\nThe row starting with a &gt; indicates information related to the DNA sequence. ID of the sequence ID1.

These sequences are generally aligned.\n\n\n\n\nFASTQ files\nFASTQ stands for FASTA Quality. They are raw data produced by sequencing instrument. Each sequence is a read. For each DNA sequence, a quality of sequencing sequence is associated.\n\n\nFirst row: Information. Name of instrument (HISEQ). Run ID (250). Flowcell ID (CADV5ANXX). Flowcell lane (5). Lane's tile (1101). Coordinates x,y (1832:1959). Wether the read is a backward(2) or forward(1) in a paired-end read or a single-end read(0). N/Y If Y the read must be removed according to quality check of sequencing instrument. No supplementary check (0) HISEQ. Barcode/index/tag of read.\nSecond row: DNA sequence\nThird row: delimiter\nLast row: quality scores are encoded into a compact form, which uses only 1 byte per quality value. In this encoding, the quality score is represented as the character with an ASCII code equal to its value + 33. For instance F corresponds to value 70-33=37. Phred-scaled quality scores are used to represent how confident we are in the assignment of each base call by the sequencer. The Phred quality score Q is logarithmically related to the error probability E.\n\nQ = -10 \\log(E)\nHere is a table of how to interpret a range of Phred Quality Scores.\nPhred Quality ScoreErrorAccuracy (1 - Error)\n1010%90%\n201%99%\n300.1%99.9%\n400.01%99.99%\n\n\n\nMetabarcoding data processing workflow\nMetabarcoding data to process are FASTQ files.\nStructure of a DNA fragment is as follow:\n5' [TAG] [PRIMER 5'] [BARCODE] [PRIMER 3'] [TAG] 3'\n\nTAG: a sequence of 8 nucleotides which indicates the original sample of the DNA fragment.\nPRIMER: a sequence used in the PCR technique. In the PCR method, a pair of primers is used to hybridize with the sample DNA and define the region of the DNA that will be amplified. In metabarcoding context, the PCR aims to amplify taxonomic group we want to target using a given primer.\nBARCODE: a hypervariable sequence which permits to identify taxonomic levels (order, class, species...). In metabarcoding context this is our sequence of interest. We want to isolate this sequence in order to detect species in a given sample.\n\nWe sequenced each DNA fragment as paired-end meaning from both extremities:\n\n\npossible forward reads (depends on wether sens or antisens brand is replicated)\n\n5' [forward TAG] [forward PRIMER 5'] [BARCODE] 3'\n5' [reverse TAG] [reverse PRIMER 5'] [BARCODE] 3'\n\n\n\npossible reverse reads (depends on wether sens or antisens brand is replicated)\n\n5' [reverse TAG] [reverse PRIMER 3'] [BARCODE] 3'\n5' [foward TAG] [forward PRIMER 3'] [BARCODE] 3'\n\n\n\nOur aims will be to reconstitute the original DNA fragment sequence from forward and reverse reads and then to isolate, filter and cluster barcode sequences. Then a taxon will be assigned to each barcode allowing detection of species in samples.\n\n\n1. Assemble reads\nilluminapairedend aligns and merges the forward and the reverse reads of a couple of paired-end sequences. When the two reads overlap with a high alignment quality score, the consensus sequence is produced.\n2. Demultiplexing\nMultiplex sequencing is a technology to sequence multiple samples at the same time on a high-throughput DNA sequencer. Samples are distinguished by the short prefix of a DNA sequence called DNA tag. The demultiplex step consists to assign to each DNA sequence its original sample.\nngsfilter seeks for tag and primer sequences in both 5' and 3' direction of each consensus sequence. The primers and tags sequences are removed and annotations about the corresponding sample is added as new attributes.\n3. Filtering and clustering\nIdentical barcode sequences are clustered using obiuniq. Then barcode sequences with a low depth coverage (meaning PCR amplification didn't work on the corresponding DNA fragment during sequencing so probably an error of sequencing) are removed using obigrep. Also, barcode sequences with a mean low quality phred-score are removed.\nobiclean annotates the barcode sequences with the tags head, internal or singleton. The tag head corresponds to sequences that possess variant sequences in the dataset without being the variant of another record. Their variants are tagged as internal. The remaining sequences are annotated with the tag singleton. A variant must be related to the head sequence record with a number of differences in the alignment under a threshold value and is defined by a ratio between its count and the count of the head sequence which must be lower than a value fixed between 0 and 1. The command obigrep is then used to get rid of internal sequences.\n4. Reference database\nThe reference database is a set of barcode sequences representative of taxon group such as species. Each taxon is located on the NCBI tree of life.\nHere the strategy to build a reference database for metabarcoding:\n\nDownload DNA sequences from known species. These sequences are mitochondrial genes (e.g. 12S or 16S for teleostei taxon group)\nDesign a primer sequence able to target taxon group of interest\necopcr is a software that simulates a PCR digestion in silico. So we use the primer to extract the barcode sequences.\nThen we use the NCBI taxonomy to assign to each barcode sequences a node of the tree of life.\n\n5. Taxonomic assignment\necotag associate the barcode sequences with taxonomic information from the reference database. It compares the record to the sequences of the provided reference database and assign the most similar one when the similarity reaches a fixed threshold. The command annotates the sequence records with the following attributes:  the sequence of the reference database that matches best, the score of identity, a unique integer taxid often referring to one taxon in the NCBI taxonomy and the scientific name linked to the taxid integer. It allows to identify the most recent common ancestor of each sequence.\n6. Format table\nSome unuseful attributes are removed. The barcode sequences are sorted by decreasing order of count. Finally, a tab-delimited file that can be open by excel or R is generated. The table is a matrix with row as barcode sequences cluster and colon as sample abundance. Taxonomic assignment for each barcode sequence is mentionned.\nConclusion\nThanks to OBItools we were able to process eDNA raw sequencing data in order to detect species among samples. First, DNA fragments are merged, then demultiplexed (each sequence is assigned to its original sample). Third, sequence barcodes are extracted, filtered and clustered by similarity. Then a taxon is assigned to each barcode sequences. Ultimately, a table of environmental presence of each species abundance among samples is produced allowing further analysis.\nReferences\n\nBlind assessment of vertebrate taxonomic diversity across spatial scales by clustering environmental DNA metabarcoding sequences\nVirginie Marques, Pierre‐Edouard Guerin, Mathieu Rocle, Alice Valentini, Stephanie Manel, David Mouillot, Tony Dejean\nEcography. 2020 Aug 04.

During this workshop, I tested Phenomenal, a pipeline designed to reconstruct the 3D architecture of maize plants grown in greenhouse conditions. I discovered a new omics called \"Phenomics\" and how high-thoughput bioimaging is used to generate phenome information at large-scale.\nPhenomics\nPhenomics is the high-throughput analysis of phenotypes. Phenotypes are observable traits such as shape, colour or growth on organisms. While genomics describe the whole genome, phenomics describe the whole phenome. The phenome is the complete set of observable traits of a given individual.\nIn plant biology, phenomics is useful to understand how plants respond to environmental factors, biotic and abiotic stress. It relies mainly on non-invasive high-throughput bioimaging.\nHigh-throughput Bioimaging\nBioimagining is the automation of large-scale acquisition of biological images. Technologies used are:\n\nMicroscopy with robot manipulating high-resolution confocal\nDrone capturing pictures of crop fields\nGreenhouse with plants in pots carried by conveyor belt to the imagining chamber\n\nUsing multi-camera system, it is possible to reconstruct from those pictures, the 3D architecture of observed plants. Morphological traits determining 3D plant architecture have a large effect on biomass accumulation via light distribution in the canopy. To observe such effect, we need a high-throughput pipeline for capturing 3D plant morphology and geometry using multi-view image reconstruction.\n3D reconstruction of maize architecture using camera\nPhenomenal is a software developed by Christophe Pradal and his team. This is an automated plant architecture analysis pipeline. It has been tested on maize in greenhouse.\n1. Image acquisition\nEach plant is imaged using a precision turntable system with two calibrated cameras (top and side views). The plant is rotated on the turntable and imaged at multiple angles (3 , 13 or 25 views), depending on the protocol. The results is a set of pictures for each plant forming the basis for 3D reconstruction.\n2. Multiple-camera calibration\nReconstruction of the 3D plant geometry from images requires the calibration of the imaging system in order to produce neat images. Using OpenCV library, the program detects the chessboard corner points in each image. Then, the 3D frame reference centered on the pot axis is defined. The chessboard is used like a reference object to calibrate the two cameras. The intrinsic calibration will refine camera parameters such as focal length, image center, lens. The extrinsic calibration will refine position and orientation of the two cameras.\n\n3. Multi-view reconstruction: Space carving with Octree voxelization\nNow we have neat 2D images and the related position, orientation of cameras and their focal length. We can start to build a 3D construct of the plant. We divide space into voxels (3D pixels). Each voxel is projected into each 2D images. Voxel that are observed on each 2D images of a given plant are considered photo-consistent.\nPostprocessing improves the 3D model. The small holes or tutor hidding the canopy on certain angles are filled. Phenomenal uses a reference view which is the one with the largest plant convex hull to recover false negative voxels. False negative are excluded voxels that are actually photo-consistent on the reference view. Such recovered voxels are grouped on pixels on which they are projected on the reference view. Then the closest neighbour voxels are also recovered. The result is an improved 3D model without \"holes\".\n\n4. Meshing\nOnce the plant is reconstructed as a 3D grid of voxels we can turn this \"blocky\" structure into a smooth surface. This is the role of meshing. Voxels are connected together to create a triangular surface mesh. IT transforms the voxel plant into a 3D model that looks like the real object.\n5. Skeletonization\nAfter voxel reconstruction and meshing, we extract the skeleton of the plant. The algorithm convert the grid of voxels into a graph of connected positions defined in a 3D space. A starting node located on the plant is selected. From this starting node, all the shortest paths to other nodes are calculated. The longest path is the main skeleton branch. For each node in the skeleton, nodes in the perpendicular plane are tagged. All nodes connected to a tagged plane are added and considered part of the leave. We obtain the main branch, the secondary branches and the leaves of the skeleton. Finally, visited paths are pruned when they are circular i.e. one node in the path is visited twice.\n\nThe skeleton is useful to calculate lot of information about the plant architecture:\n\nPlant:\n\nNumber of leaf\nVolume, surface\nMaximal height\nConvex hull\n\n\nLeaves:\n\nVolume\nInsertion\nLength\nMaximum and mean width\n\n\nStem:\n\nLength\nHeigth\nDiameter\n\n\n\n\n6. Analysis\nThe automated pipeline for 3D architectural reconstruction enables high-frequency phenotyping. Maize trait can be observed hourly and under varying greenhouse conditions. These phenotypes measurments can be stored as tables and used for statstical analyses e.g. growth modeling or QTL mapping. Furthermore this also can be used as input for genotype–phenotype prediction using machine learning approaches.\nThe Montpellier Plant Phenotyping Platforms (M3P)\nThis high-throughput phenotyping platforms (PhenoArch, PhenoDyn and PhenoPsis), grouped together in the Montpellier Plant Phenotyping Platforms (M3P), are used to analyse and model the genetic variability of plant response to environmental stresses and climate change (particularly drought and high temperatures).\nM3P is one of the 10 nodes of the french infrastructure for phenotyping. The European infrastructure counts 200 nodes.\n\nPhenopsis irrigates precisely and take a picture of more than 500 individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants in rigorously controlled conditions.\nPhenoDyn measures growth rate and transpiration rate of 420 plants every minute, together with environmental conditions.\nPhenoArch aims at analysing the genetic determinisms of plant responses to environmental\nconditions in particular drought, temperature and light (2400 plants).\n\nPhenoArch\nPhenoArch is a phenotyping platform dedicated to the analysis of genetic determinisms of plant response (growth, transpiration, development) to environmental conditions, in particular drought, temperature and light.\nInstalled in a 350 m² greenhouse, it is based on a conveyor belt that transports 1700 potted plants between irrigation areas and an imaging chamber. It allows multi-trait association studies to be carried out under contrasting soil water conditions and climate scenarios. The characteristics measured are biomass (via biovolumes), transpiration and architecture. The images collected and the monitoring of pot weights allow growth and transpiration to be estimated and water use efficiency to be assessed.\nAnalysis pipelines are used to estimate the incident radiation and the radiation intercepted by each plant and to deduce the radiation use efficiency.\nPhenoArch is covered with environmental sensors to estimate the conditions perceived by the plants at each moment. The throughput of PhenoArch allows it to be used for association genetics analysis as well as for genomic selection.\nExample of an experiment carried out on PhenoArch:\n\n    \n    \nReferences\n\nReproHackathon GDR MaDICS IFB-ElixirFr/ReproHackathon\n\n\nPhenomenal: An automatic open source library for 3D shoot architecture reconstruction and analysis for image-based plant phenotyping\nSimon Artzet, Tsu-Wei Chen, Jérôme Chopard, Nicolas Brichet,  Mielewczik, Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, Llorenç Cabrera-Bosquet, François Tardieu, Christian Fournier, Christophe Pradal\nbioRxiv. 21 October 2019.

This technology provides access to gene expression profiles in various conditions such as viral infection or environmental stress. I had the opportunity to process RNA-Seq data from sugar beet plants to investigate transcriptional responses to virus yellows disease, a condition caused by a complex of aphid-transmissible viruses. Here, I describe transcriptomics and the methods used for RNA-Seq data analysis.\nRNA molecules\nRibonucleic Acid (RNA), unlike Desoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is not a long double-stranded molecule. While DNA function is the long-term storage of genetic information and its transmission to new organisms, RNA is used to transcribe the genetic information within the organism. While DNA is self-replicating and has a very stable molecular structure, whereas RNA is synthesized from DNA and is highly reactive. RNA is constantly produced, used, degraded and recycled. The overall activity involving RNA is referred to as gene expression.\nThere are different types of RNA:\n\nRibosomal RNA (rRNA): Constitute the ribosome, agent of translation of the transcript.\nMessenger RNA (mRNA): Carry the blueprint for building proteins in the ribosome. In eukaryotes, mRNA often has a 5' cap and a 3' polyadenylated (poly-A) tail that enhance stability and translation efficiency.\nTransfer RNA (tRNA): Bring amino acids to the ribosome during translation.\nSmall RNA (sRNA): Regulatory roles\nAnd many more: IncRNA, eRNA, scaRNA, gRNA, piRNA, etc.\n\nSplicing of mRNA\nAfter transcription, the mRNA contains both coding regions (exons) and non-coding regions (introns). During splicing, the introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form a continuous coding sequence. In some cases, splicing can happen in different ways. It allows a single gene to produce different versions of a protein called isoforms. The splicing is controlled by a molecular machinery called spliceosome. This increases the variety of proteins that can be generated using the same gene.\nCapping and Polyadenylation\nCapping is the addition of 7-methylguanosine (M7G) cap to the 5'end of a mRNA. It protects the mRNA from degradation and improve it's affinity with the ribosome.\nPolyadenylation is the addition of a poly-A tail i.e. a long chain of Adenine (A) nucleotides to the 3'end of a mRNA. This tail protects the mRNA from degradation and improves translation efficiency by ribosomes. Moreover, the poly-A is essential to select mRNA from other types of RNA molecules.\n\nHigh-throughput RNA sequencing\nRNA-sequencing is a High-Throughput Sequencing technique for identifying and quantifying RNA molecules in biological samples. This technology is used for assessing gene expression or splicing of transcripts.\n\nSample preparation and library generation\nRNA purification\nAfter tissue extraction, for instance a leaf, the total RNA is isolated from sample. RNA quality is assessed. If RNA integrity is good enough, the RNA is purified to keep the selected type.\nThe most typical library preparation protocol uses the poly-A selection strategy for purifying mRNA by filtering RNA with 3' polyadenylated poly-A tails to include only mRNA. As a result, non polyadenylated transcripts such as rRNA, tRNA, lncRNAs, miRNA, histone mRNA, degraded RNA, bacterial transcripts, and many viral transcripts are removed.\nFurther, the ribosomal depletion is conducted to remove rRNA as it represents over 90% of the RNA in a cell, which if kept would drown out other data in the transcriptome.\ncDNA synthesis\nSequencer such as Illumina require DNA, not RNA, as input. Therefore, before sequencing, the RNA must be reverse-transcribed into cDNA. cDNA, or complementary DNA, is a DNA copy synthesized from an RNA molecule using the enzyme reverse transcriptase.\nStranded mRNA protocol\nThe DNA is double-stranded meaning it has two strands sense and antisense. The bases on one strand (A, T, G, C) pair with complementary bases on the other strand (A with T, C with G). The mRNA is a copy of the strand sense or antisense but not both. To ease downstream analysis, it is fortunate to keep the right strand.\nWhen the second strand of cDNA is synthesized, the protocol uses the introduction of dUTP instead of dTTP during amplification. The incorporation of dUTP in the second strand synthesis block the production of the second strand. In consequences, only the transcripted strand is kept in the final library. With stranded sequencing, we have no ambiguity and better estimation of gene expression level.\nAdapter ligation\nThe remaining RNA is degraded and a second DNA strand is synthesized to produce double-stranded cDNA. The 5' and 3' ends of cDNA fragments are next prepared to allow efficient ligation of adapters containing unique barcodes and adapters for hybridization of cDNA fragments onto a flowcell.\nAmplification\nBefore sequencing, the cDNA is usually amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to obtain enough material. However, PCR can create duplicates. Duplicates are identical reads that originate not from different RNA molecules, but from repeated amplification of the same original fragment. These PCR duplicates can bias expression measurements. To solve this, a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) random barcode is added to each original molecule before amplification.\nMultiplexing\nTo save time and cost, sequencing often uses multiplexing, where multiple samples are mixed and sequenced together in a single run. Each sample is labeled with a unique barcode during library preparation.\nSequencing\nThe sequencer reads the base sequence (A, T, C, G) of each cDNA fragment. Each of these sequences is called a read. Depending on the technology and the protocol, RNA-Seq can produce:\n\nIn single-end sequencing, the machine reads from one end of each fragment. They are are used for gene expression quantification.\nIn paired-end sequencing, it reads from both ends of each fragment, higher precision.It is useful for detecting splicing events and refinement of transcriptome annotation.\n\nAt the end of the read, the sequencing accuracy tends to drop. This is a common issue, especially in  Illumina sequencing due to signal decay. This bias is solved thanks to bioinformatics software that clean low quality tail of read sequence.\nThe output of RNA-Seq is first demultiplexed yielding either one FASTQ file per sample (for single-end reads protocol) or two fastq-files per sample (for paired-end reads protocol).\n\nBiological replicates in an RNA-seq experiment\nTo improve reliability of differential gene expression detection, it is necessary to include multiple independent samples from each condition. These biological replicates capture the variability in gene expression within the same conditions.\nIndeed, with fewer than three replicates per condition, it becomes difficult to estimate variability within groups, making it difficult to detect significant differences of gene expression between conditions.\nAs the number of replicates increases, the sensitivy and specificy of differential gene expression detection methods also improve. For robust detection of differential gene expression, at least six replicates per condition are recommended.\nFor experiment with fewer than 12 replicates, use edgeR.\nFor 12 or more replicates, use DESeq2.\n\nRNA-Seq Bioinformatics Pipeline\n\n1. Cleaning\nWe check the quality of RNA-Seq fastq files and remove adapters, contaminants and low quality sequences.\n\nControl quality is performed with FASTQC\nIllumina adapters sequences are trimmed using cutadapt\nTrimgalore removed low quality 3' tail sequence of reads\nUnique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are removed and extracted to be added to the read name\numitools groups PCR duplicates and deduplicates reads to yield one read per group of PCR clones\n\n2. Read mapping\nA genome reference in FASTA format contains the entire genomic sequence i.e. the chromosomes of an organism. It is used for mapping read sequences of mRNA onto the reference genome.\nThe annotation of the genome in GTF format provide the location of genes, introns or exons on the reference genomic sequence.\nrsem-prepare-reference from RSEM generates the transcriptome FASTA file from FASTA genome reference and annotation GTF file. The transcriptome is the complete set of RNA molecules that can be transcribed from the reference genomic sequence.\nTo determine where on the transcriptome our reads originated from, we align our reads to the reference genome using STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference). STAR is an aligner designed to specifically address many of the challenges of RNA-Seq data mapping using a strategy to account for spliced alignments.\n3. Quantification\nNow that we have our mapping (.BAM files) and a transcriptome (.FASTA file) we can quantify in alignment-based mode with Salmon.\nFor each sample, we generate a quantification file quant.sf. This file is a plain-text, tab-separated file with a single header line (which names all of the columns).Each row describes a single quantification record. The columns have the following interpretation.\n\nName: name of the target transcript provided in the input transcript database (FASTA file).\nLength: length of the target transcript in nucleotides.\nEffectiveLength: This is the computed effective length of the target transcript. (Scaled length with observed different lengths for a same transcript)\nTPM: relative abundance of this transcript in units of Transcripts Per Million (TPM).\nNumReads: number of reads mapping to each transcript that was quantified. It is an “estimate” insofar as it is the expected number of reads that have originated from each transcript given the structure of the uniquely mapping and multi-mapping reads and the relative abundance estimates for each transcript.\n\n4. Differential Expression Analysis\nDESeq2 is an R/Bioconductor implemented method to detect differentially expressed features. It tests for differential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models. DESeq2 is based on the hypothesis that most genes are not differentially expressed.\nTwo input files are required:\n\nGene expression count matrix: results of the processing of RNA-Seq data, quantification of gene expression level by samples. This is a table of raw counts with row as gene and column as samples. Indeed the DESeq2 model internally corrects for library size.\nSample metadata: Information about samples such as condition or genotype\n\nDESeq2 identifies genes with statistically significant differences in expression level between experimental conditions.\nDESeq2 supports multifactor experimental designs, allowing the simultaneous analysis of multiple variables or conditions that may influence gene expression. This is important when experiments involve complex setups, such as different conditions, time points, genotypes, populations, etc.\nOutputs of differential expression analysis:\n\nLog2 fold changes for each factor and their interactions, indicating how much gene expression increases or decreases under specific conditions compared to a reference.\nStatistical significance values (p-values) for each factor and interaction term, showing which genes are differentially expressed with confidence.\n\nVisualization\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals cluster of samples related to experimental factors and driven by the observed gene expression levels.\nHeatmaps with Dendrograms display sample correlation and sample-to-sample distances based on observed gene expression levels. The dendogram give hierarchical cluster of experimental factors.\n\n\nIn this example of differential expression visualization, two factors are considered: condition and differentiation. The condition factor includes two groups: KO (knockout) and WT (wild type), while the differentiation factor has two groups: diff5days and undiff. The dendrogram shows hierarchical clustering of the samples based on both condition and differentiation. The heatmap displays the similarity of gene expression levels between samples, where blue indicates samples with similar expression profiles and red represents samples with more distinct expression patterns. As you can see, samples with the same condition and differentiation shows similar expression profiles, whereas samples with different condition or differentation shows different profiles. The differential expression analysis demonstrates that both condition and differentiation have an effect on gene expression.\n5. Functional Analysis\nFollowing differential expression analysis, the list of genes of interest are investigated. Gene Ontology and pathway databases reveals overrepresented biological functions and metabolic pathways related to the genes of interest. The functional analysis helps connect observed changes in gene expression to known biological processes.\nConclusion\nWe can extract and purify RNA, then convert it into cDNA to sequence the mRNA. Thanks to bioinformatics, we can cross transcriptome information with the sequencing data (reads) to measure how active each gene is by quantifying its expression level. This information is useful for differential expression analysis which compares gene expression levels between different conditions or groups in order to identify genes that are involved. Finally, RNA-Seq is a powerful tool to pinpoint which genes play an active role in a disease or any biological process. For instance,breeders use RNA-Seq to identify genes associated with resistance to biotic stress e.g. yellow virus infection in sugar beet.\nReferences\n\nRNA-Seq analysis how-to: Julien Delafontaine\nRNA splicing: Isabelle Stevant\nCourse to process RNA-Seq data: PHINDaccess RNAseq course 2020\nHow to run RNA-Seq data processing: GenoToul Bioinfo Course\nRNA sequencing analysis pipeline: nf-core/rnaseq\n\n\nAphid-mediated beet yellows virus transmission initiates proviral gene deregulation in sugar beet at early stages of infection\nRoxana Hossain, Glenda Willems, Niels Wynant, Simon Borgolte\nPLOS One. 2024 October 19.

The difference is that you need to specify needed resources beforehand. The cluster is controlled by a SGE (Sun Grid Engine Software) that organizes the queues and resources. This sort of scheduling system is necessary when limited computational resources are shared by many. Here I show how to use Sun Grid Engine for job submission, monitoring and troubleshooting.\n Sun Grid Engine\nCluster environment such as MBB is similar as unix/linux environments for job submission (e.g. running your scripts or other software). The difference is that you need to specify needed resources beforehand. The cluster is controlled by a SGE (Sun Grid Engine software) that orders the queues and resources. This sort of scheduling system is necessary when limited computational resources are shared by many.\nSGE will do the job scheduling. That means you can submit all your jobs and SGE will queue them and run them when resources you requested becomes available. SGE will also achieve load balancing where the jobs will be distributed so that specific nodes do not get overloaded. In addition, SGE will allow you to do job monitoring which will be useful when you want to check if your job is running ,and if it failed it will help you understand what went wrong.\nAccess and use the cluster\nThe SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

It serves as a basis for formulating the research question and developing related hypotheses.\n\n\n\"We are like dwarfs seated on the shoulders of giants. We see more, and farther, not because of the sharpness of our sight or the greatness of our stature, but because we are carried high and lifted up by their giant size.\"\nBernard de Chartres, 1159\n\nWhy to write a State of the Art?\nIn science, being the first to present research findings is crucial. For instance let's imagine that my research question is \"How are colors and shapes transmitted from one generation to the next in pea?\". You cannot gain recognition by rediscovering Mendel's laws of inheritance in peas and presenting them as your own. Mendel did it in 1865, and everyone knows it because he published it. When Mendel published his work, it was novel. Today, any researcher must demonstrate novelty by presenting a state of the art and showing that no one has yet answered the question they address. That’s why Mendel’s work remains foundational, whereas repeating the same experiment will not bring you recognition for you work as your research question is already answered.\nBesides, they are many advantages to write state of the art:\n\nIt is the best way to learn about your research question and refine it.\nIt helps you to formulate relevant questions as the ones that many people in the field are trying to solve.\nCollection of different points of view and approaches to a solution. Which ones are promising, which ones are dead-end and which ones are unexplored yet.\nIt gathers the tools, methods and elements previous researchers made for you to help you find a solution on your question.\nIt's enough consistent to stand as publication on its own which can then be cited by next articles.\n\nHow to write a State of the Art?\n1. Determine initial research question and field\nWritting a good State of the Art relies on the problem definition. If your problem is not clearly defined, your report will be miscellaneous.\n\nWhat is the research question to be addressed?\nWhat field of knowledge will the search address?\n\n2. Determine time frame\nSome problems or fields have centuries of scientific works and publications. It is therefore crucial to define the scope of the literature we will consider. From which year onward we will focus.\n\nWhat historical markers help demarcate the time frame of now?\nWhat time frame can be justified to mark the beginning of the review?\n\n3. Refine research question to fit with the new time frame\nGiven the information of the time frame and its main scope, you may adjust the initial question to align with the newly acquired information.\n4. Strategy to find and classify relevant articles\n\nEstablish a list of key words related to your question\nSearch using key words or expressions an article that already did a state of the art. Then you can use this state of the art as a basis for yours and refine it.\nIf you didn't find an already existing state of the art perfectly matching your question in the literature, then collect articles containing your key words.\nSystematically read only the conclusion &amp; perspective of all the collected articles and keep articles that have conclusion related to your question.\nUse one of these article as a seed meaning list all the articles in the reference section that may be related to your question and apply step 4 again.\nAfter trying many seeds you should start to have a consistent corpus of articles. A good indicator is when the reference sections of the articles you are screening begin to repeat the same sources.\nStop reading new articles.\nOrganize your raw corpus of articles. You classify them according to a chronology, group them by ideas, themes, fields, technology, authors, etc. You can also visualize how articles are related to each others using tools like connectedpapers.\n\nAnother tip: check Github/Gitlab repositories to see if they are an existing tool available online. Compare published code source of tools addressing the same problem. Often, all these tools are redundant or forks so you may realise that lengthy articles are not necessary presenting great improvment or change on an original method. Even more often, they are no published tool or source code at all despite the claim of the author in their article. You can try to contact the authors to ask the archive of the source code by e-mail. But again, often you will have no answer. This help you to filter articles and associated work that are not relevant.\nLast tip: check travaux parlementaires of the French Senate. Often this is first class scientific reports with excellent basis for a state of the art. It also give you a non-scientific point of view on a field or a scientific problem. This may help you to check if you didn't forget articles and point of views related to your research question.\n5. Analyses\nRead the articles to become familiar with the corpus.\n\nWhat are the similarities across articles?\nWhat are gaps and assumptions in the current knowledge?\nWhich articles support or contradict your thinking?\nDo certain authors dominate the literature?\n\n6. Technological watch\nOnce you did your first state of the art, the work is not over. You will continue to watch what other researchers are publishing. This require a system for recording and summarizing your readings. Use bibliography softwares such as Zotero to record every day your understanding of what your read.\nReferences\n\nHow to Conduct a State-of-the-Art Literature Review\nErin Barry, Jerusalem Merkebu, Lara Varpio\nJournal of Graduate Medical Education, 2016.

A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. As of June 2019, there were over 14,000 packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, the public clearing house for R packages. In this article I describe how to create a R package step-by-step so that others can easily download and use your code.\n\n“In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package.

You can still share your project with project by hosting it on github.\n\nSign up/in to github and create a new repository.\nCheck the github repository address on the github quick set up page.\nOn Rstudio open a new project as new folder R package. Activate the use git option. For instance, I call the package mon_premier_package. This will create a ready-to-use empty R package.\nConnect your local R package to the github repository. Go to terminal in Rstudio and type:\n\n\n\nThat's it ! Your R package is hosted as an online github repository.\n\nThis automatically creates the bare bone files and directories needed to define our R package called mon_premier_package.\n\n\nR folder will eventually contain our R code.\nman folder will eventually contain documentation.\nmon_premier_package.Rproj file is specific to the RStudio IDE.\nDESCRIPTION folder holds our package’s metadata.\nNAMSPACE is a file that ensures our library plays nicely with others, and is more of a CRAN requirement.\n\nBuild the package\nIn Rstudio, click on Check then Install and restart. These commands will automatically install your package. Alternatively, you can run these commands  from the terminal:\n\nThen your package is ready-to-use and available. It can be installed in any R session with devtools using install_github function:\n\nNow you can share the skeleton of your package to anybody, so let's add muscle and skin to it.\nAdd Functions\nWrite R file in R Folder\nOur package wouldn’t do much without functions. Let’s add a function. Here the R file hello_world.R contains the code source for the function hellow_world:\n\n\nLines beginning with a #' are mandatory to generate documentation describing the function.\nWe have to add our function to the R folder, since this is where R looks for any functions inside a library.\n\n\nWrite documentation\nTo create documentation describing your function.\n\nThis will generate a man folder and .Rd documentation files describing functions in R folder.\n\nCheck the documentation is working well:\n\nThis command returns:\n\nContinuous integration with travis\n\nThe idea behind continuous integration is that CI will automatically run R CMD check (along with your tests, etc.) every time you push a commit to GitHub. CI automatically checks the code after every commit and return you if the build is a succes or not. See blog post by Julia Silge for a beginner's guide to Travis-CI for R.\nConclusion\nHere we learnt how to quickly build a R package. Creating R package is a critical skill for any scientist, and something I encourage others to do regularly.

Does writing well matter in an age of instant communication? According to Pinker, yes it does, but we must minimize the flaws of the post-modern style. Writing has never been natural for humans. Some difficulties are as old as writting itself, some are new, and some have only recently been revealed thanks to cognitive science and linguistics. Here, I have summarized the advices from Pinker on how to write in a better style.\nWhy is so much writing so bad?\nWhy do we have to struggle with so much legalese?\n\n\"The revocation by these Regulations of a provision previously revoked subject to savings does not affect the continued operations.\"\n\nWith so much academese?\n\n\"It is the moment of non-construction, disclosing the absentation of actuality from the concept in part through its invitation to emphasize, in reading, the helplessness of its fall into conceptuality.\"\n\nWhy is it so hard to set the time on a digital alarm clock?\n\n\n\nAs captured in this cartoon from Mark Dubowski, a first theory could be that bad writing is a deliberate choice. Perhaps this is the way bureaucrats choose to retaliate against society. This may be true that some writers are banboozling their readers some of the time. But it doesn't ring true. Because good scientist can also write bad prose.\n\n\nA second theory is that digital media stupifies the new generation. Writting was better in previous times. Actually, complains about the immediate decline of our language can be found in every area:\n\nMass media age\n\n\"Recent graduates, including those with university degrees, seem to have no mastery of the language at all.\"\nJoseph Mersand, writer, 1961\n\n\nTelegraph age\n\n\"Our freshmen can't spell, can't puncutate. Every high school is in disrepair because its pupils are so ignorant of the merest rudiments.\"\nCharles Henshaw Ward, teacher, 1917\n\n\nModern age\n\n\"Our language is degenerating very fast... I begin to fear that it will be impossible to check it.\"\nJames Beattie, poet and philosophy professor, 1785\n\n\nPharaoh age (according to this cartoon from Wiley Ink)\n\n\n\n\nLast theory according to Charles Darwin is that every man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children, whereas no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew or write. Speaking is instinctive whereas writting is hard.\n\n\nThe Problem with Traditional Style Advice\nAs writting is the result of a work, we should follow rules from style advice book for instance The Element of Style from Elwyn Brooks White (yes the author of the infamous Stuart Little). However such advices are useless to write in the style of the 21st century:\n\nArbitrary list of dos and don'ts based on the tastes and peeves of the authors\nNo principled understanding of how language works\n\nWhy we can write in a better Style in the 21st Century\nIn the 21st century, the style advices are based on science:\n\nLanguage structure theory: Grammar is not a set of arbitrary rules inherited from Latin language. It is a natural organization of the words we speak, and thefore it can be described.\nEvidence-based dictionaries: Unlike prescriptive dictionaries that may impose incorrect or outdated usages.\nCognitive science: What makes sentences easy or hard to read.\n\nClassic Style\nIn Academia, the good writting style is the classic style:\n\nProse as a window onto the world\n\nThe writer has seen something in the world.\nHe positions the reader so she can see it with her own eyes.\n\n\nThe reader and writer are equals\nThe goal is to help the reader see objective reality\nThe style is conversation\n\nWhat are Non-Classic Styles?\nClassic style is just one of a variety of styles. They are many: contemplative, oracular, practical, etc. However, they are one style that infects most academic prose, they called it the post-modern style or ego style:\n\nThe writer is concerned about seeming naive to the reader.\n\nNaive means without knowledge or experience. For instance when you open a recipe cookbook, as a reader, you put aside some existential questions like Do eggs really exist?, What is cooking and why do we cook?, Is food something knowledgeable?, etc. In a cookbook, such questions are inappropriate, and the classic style ignores them. The purpose is to treat exclusively the subject, the recipe in the case of a cookbook.\nClassic vs. Post-Modern Prose\nThe focus is on the thing being shown not on the activity of studying it.\n\nPost-Modern\n\n\"In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have turned their attention to the problem of child language acquisition. In this article, recent theories of this process will be reviewed.\"\n\n\nClassic\n\n\"All children acquire the ability to speak without explicit lessons. How do they accomplish this feat?\"\n\n\n\nMinimize Apology\n\n\"The problem of language acquisition is extremely complex. It is difficult to give precise definitions of the concept of language and the concept of acquisition and the concept of children. There is much uncertainty about the interpretation of experimental data and a great deal of controversy surrounding the theories. More research needs to be done.\"\n\n\nYou can delete this lengthy verbiage with no loss in content.\nThe reader already know that many concepts are hard to define\nThe reader is there to see what the writer will do about it\n\nMinimize hedging\n\nliterally, somewhat, fairly, rather, nearly, relatively, seemingly, comparatively, apparently, etc.\nSudder quotes \"\"\n\nShe is a \"quick study\" and has been able to educate herself in virtually any area that interests her\n\n\n\nThe compulsive hedging is a manner to cover our words so we can stay ambiguous e.g She virtually loved it..\n\nTake the risk to be clear and possibly wrong than muddy and not even wrong.\nNot everything has to be stated with absolute precision.\n\nMinimize Clichés\n\nEach time you use a cliché, the reader shutdowns their imagination\nAvoid clichés like the plague:\n\n\"We needed to think outside the box in our search for the holy grail, but found that it was neither a magic bullet, so we rolled with the punches and let the chips fall where they may while seeing the glass as half-full. It's a no-brainer!\"\n\n\n\nMinimize Meta\n\nWrite about the world not about how you write about it.\nAvoid metaconcepts i.e concepts about concepts: approach, assumption, concept, condition, context, framework, issue, level, model, paradigm, perspective, process, role, strategy, tendency, variable, etc.\n\nMinimize Zombie Nouns\n\nNominalization is turning a verb into a noun. Instead of appearing you make an appearance.\nBad usage examples:\n\nIn academia:\n\n🧟 \"Subjects were tested under conditions of good to excellent acoustic isolation.\"\n✅ \"We tested the students in a quiet room.\"\n\n\nIn politics:\n\n🧟 \"The President is desirous of trying to see how we can make our best efforts in order to find a way to facilitate.\"\n✅ \"The President wants to help.\"\n\n\nIn engineering:\n\n🧟 \"Mild exposure to CO can result in accumulated damage over time. Extreme exposure to CO may rapidly be fatal without producing significant warning symptoms.\"\n✅ \"Using a generator indoors CAN KILL YOU IN MINUTES.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimize the Passive Form\nPassive form like nominalization contributes to turn your prose into zombie prose. However the passive form could not have survived for 1500 years if it did not serve some purpose. So how to prevent people to overuse it?\nPresent yourself the language like an application for converting a web of thoughts into a string of words.\nFor instance the play Oedipus of Sophocles is composed of:\n\nSubjects: Oedipus, Jocasta, Laius\nActions: is, kill, marry\nFunctions: father, mother, wife, husband, son\n\nThe summary of Oedipus is: \"Oedipus married his mother and killed his father.\"\nHere the summary is incoherent. Why? Because a sentence is a string of words and in the english language the order of words matters.\n\nWords oder is used as a code for meaning who did what to whom\nIs also the order in which the bits of information are absorbed by the reader\n\nThe material at the beginning of the sentence are information required to understand what will happen.\nThe material at the end of the sentence are what the reader should now notice.\n\n\n\nAny prose that violates this principles will be incoherent. Hopefully, English syntax provides writers with constructions such as passive form to vary the order of words while preserving meaning:\n\nOedipus killed Laius\nLaius was killed by Oedipus\nIt was Laius whom Oedipus killed\nIt was Oedipus who killed Laius\n\nWriters must choose the construction that introduces information to the reader in the order in which she can absorb them.\nMinimize semantic distinction\nIn general, one should avoid reaching for a hoity-toity word to replace a humber synonym.\n\nfulsome is not equivalent to full\nsimplistic is not equivalent to simple\ncomplex is not equivalent to complicated\n\nMinimize correct usage\nCorrect usage should be kept in perspective:\n\nThe least important part of good writting\nfar less important than\n\nclassic style\ncoherent ordering of ideas\novercoming the curse of knowledge\nargumentation\n\n\nTacit, evolving conventions\n\n\nSense vs. Usage\n\nSense: the meaning of a word, as defined in the dictionary.\nUsage: how a word is used by people depending on the context.\n\nSense and usage don’t always match. A word’s meaning may be twisted by its common usage.\nExample: a review originally referred to a military inspection. Common usage has shifted it to mean a journal.\n\nThe Curse of Knowledge\nDoes not occur to the writer that readers...\n\nhave learned their jargon\ndo know the intermediate steps that seem too obvious to mention\ncan visualize a scene currently in the writer's mind's eye\n\nAnd so the writer does not bother to...\n\nexplain the jargon\nspell out the logic\nsupply the concrete details\n\nHow to overcome the curse?\n\nGet a flesh and blood person to read your writting. It can be your mother or yourself several days later.\nAllow your reader to form a mental image based on what you're writting.\n\nAn idea is not a string of words, the mind must grasp it\nUse concrete examples\nUse visual metaphors and symboles instead of abstract terms\n\n\n\nConclusion\nModern linguistic and cognitive science provide better ways of enhancing our writing. A model of prose communication, the classic style in which language is a window on the world. We better understand how language works as a way of converting a web of thoughts into a string of words. The main reason writing remains difficult, however, is the curse of knowledge. A challenge every writer must recognize and overcome.\nTo go further\nSteven Pinker is a linguist, Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.\n\n    \n    \nReferences\n\nThe Royal Institution Talk film:  Linguistics, Style and Writing in the 21st Century with Steven Pinker\n\n\nThe Sense of Style\nSteven Pinker\nThe Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century, 2022.

Over time, I developed habits that I present in this article.\n What's Git?\nWhen a programming project becomes more complex, you need to versionize it. Either a natural progression of the project over time or simply to add additional options. Managing these versions remains tedious as the project grows and even becomes risky when the project involves several collaborators.\nGit is the software that manages the versioning of files. More precisely, it forces users to version their files systematically. Finally, don't confuse Git with Gitlab, Github, or bitbucket, which are forges. A forge is a web-based collaborative software platform for both developing and sharing computer applications. it encompasses much more functionality than version management.\nI defined two types of usage for Git (front and back). The front part corresponds to a very basic use of Git, adapted to work in turn. The back part is a more advanced use of Git wich requires branches. This involves checking out a new branch, working on it, and then merging the changes into the main master branch into a single commit.\nDownload as PDF\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPro Git\nScott Chacon and Ben Straub\nPro Git, 2nd edition, Apress, 2014. https://git-scm.com/book/\n\n","id":"https://guerinpe.com/articles/team-working-with-git/","title":"Team Working with Git"},"https://guerinpe.com/articles/turing-complete-from-logical-gates-to-cpu-architecture/":{"body":"In 2021, LevelHead published Turing Complete, a game about computer science. My friend Christophe Georgescu recommended me to play it. Unfortunately, I took his advice and now I can not stop to play this game! The game challenges you to design an entire computer from scratch. You start with basic logic gates, then move on to components, memory, CPU architecture, and finally assembly programming. By the way, the game is neat and present all these concepts in a playful and intuitive way.\nTruth Tables\nA truth table shows how the truth or falsity of a compound statement depends on the truth or falsity of the simple statements from which it is constructed.\nExample with the AND gate:\nInput 1Input 2Output\n❌❌❌\n✅❌❌\n❌✅❌\n✅✅✅\n\nInput and Output will often be represented with variable names, like in algebra. And instead of using colors, you will often see the values represented as 0/1 or False/True.\nLogical Gates\nIt turns out tht you can build all the logic for a computer out of either NAND or NOR gates. The Apollo guidance computers, were built entirely of NOR gates. Designed in the sixties, they had only 4KB of RAM and 32KB of disk space, but guided astronauts to the moon nonetheless.\nModern computers are not built entirely of just one of the logical gates, but when applicable NAND gates are prefered over NOR, because they have less delay and occupy less area.\n\nNAND gate\n\n1 unless both inputs are 1.\nInput 1Input 2Output\n001\n101\n011\n110\n\nAND gate\n\n1 when both inputs are 1.\nInput 1Input 2Output\n000\n100\n010\n111\n\nOR gate\n\n1 when either input is 1\nInput 1Input 2Output\n000\n101\n011\n111\n\nNOR gate\n\n1 when neither inputs are 1.\nInput 1Input 2Output\n001\n100\n010\n110\n\nXOR gate\n\n1 when inputs are different\nInput 1Input 2Output\n000\n101\n011\n110\n\nXNOR gate\n\n1 when inputs are the same.\nInput 1Input 2Output\n001\n100\n010\n111\n\nBuffer\n\nOutputs this tick's input, next tick.\nNOT gate\n\nInverts the input.\nInputOutput\n01\n10\n\nDe Morgan's Laws\nThe truth tables of the four fundamental gates are symmetrical. You can convert betwee, them by inverting the input (vertical arrows) or inverting the output (horizontal arrows) as indicated by the graphic below.\n\nNotes:\n\nYou can get from any basic gate to any other, at most you have to NOT both inputs and output.\nYou can go between OR/NOR by inverting output. The same goes AND/NAND. In fact NOR means NOT OR and NAND means NOT AND. Notice the component shape of OR/NOR are identical except for the little dot at the tip which means NOT. AND/NAND are also identical except for this dot.\nNegating the output flips all the bits in the last row of the truth table.

As more communities are using Docker or Singularity, we enter into the age of high reproducibility or at least replicability so that the use of containers is mandatory for any study.\nThe need to produce reproducible experiments in computer science\nWhat is reproducibility ?\nReproducibility is the closeness of the agreement between the results of measurements of the same measurand carried out with the same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal and associated source code)\nWhy work in a reproducible way ?\nIn practice, this serves to validate scientific experience without guaranteeing its accuracy, correctness or relevance. It is also relevant to test assumptions and facilitate the publication of results. About computer sciences, numerical calculation and modelisation must be replicable and reproducible but also reusable.\nHow to work in a reproducible way ?\nPrinciple of the R5 (ReSciences)\nRerunnable\n\nCan you re-run your program ?\nOne day, one week, one month, one year (just kidding) apart ?\n\nRepeatable\n\nCan you re-run your program and get same results ?\nDid you save everything, including random seed ?\n\nReplicable\n\nCan someone reimplement your model and get same results ?\nDid you describe everything ?\n\nReproducible\n\nCan someone re-run your program and get same results ?\nDid you save the software stack ?\n\nReusable\n\nCan someone reuse your program using different data ?\nIs your software data-dependent ?\n\nVirtual environments are reproducible environments\nToday, industries and research centers make massive use of virtual machines. These machines run apps under a guest operating system, which uses virtual hardware emulated by the host operating system of the real machine. In this article, we focus on virtualisation. The great interest being to be able to ignore all the attributes of the host system and to emulate another system in order to have a portable and therefore reproducible environment from one machine to another. For instance, Java works on this principle of virtualisation (yes. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine). Virtual Box is one of the best known tools for making Virtual Machines.\nWhat is a container ?\nThe isolation between guest and host is excellent, but it is expensive to emulate the virtual hardware and run a complete guest operating system. Containers can be seen as a lighter variant: by exploiting more directly the lower layers of the host system (kernel), the containers provide almost as much isolation as virtual machines, at a much lower performance cost.\nSo, a container is a lightweight, memory-loaded virtual machine that is used to launch an application within an isolated and reproducible environment. A container is instantiated from an image. An image is a static description of a container which you can exchange with your employees and from which containers can be instantiated and executed.\nSingularity\nSingularity enables users to have full control of their environment. Singularity containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you don’t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a Singularity container and run.\nBuild an image\nIn the file below, which we will call Singularity.myRecipe, we start from an ubuntu docker image, on which we add the wget and build-essential packages. We also create a directory that will contain our data, in fact we can use any bash command in this bootstrap file.\n\nTo build the container for this recipe file, use the command build:\n\nThe file containing the container is example.simg. We created a portable virtual environment for our scientific analysis. Note that you need to have sudo privilege to build a container with singularity.\nCommands\nTo get into the container, you launch a shell inside:\n\nTo execute a command (for instance ls /data) from inside the container:\n\nA tricky case as you are working on a mounted disk at /media/disk you need to change the path of the container too:\n\nDownload ready-to-use container\nAlready built images are available on https://singularity-hub.org (check my personnal collection of containers I made here).\nFor instance, you can download a container with the required software to run my metabarcoding analysis:\n\nDocker\nDocker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in a public cloud, and/or in a private cloud.\nBuild an image\nDocker creates a container from a configuration file named Dockerfile or recipe in the workdir directory. Let's build an image for apache.\n\nTo build the container for this recipe file, use the command build:\n\nNow you can run apache using the container:\n\nCommands\nExecute a command from whithin the container:\n\nInteractive shell from the container:\n\nDownload ready-to-use docker container\nTo download a particular image, or set of images (i.e., a repository), use docker pull. If no tag is provided, Docker Engine uses the :latest tag as a default. This command pulls the debian:jessie image:\n\nCheck your images on docker\n\nDocker vs. Singularity for data processing\nSingularity is a container runtime, like Docker, but it starts from a very different place. It favors integration rather than isolation, while still preserving security restrictions on the container, and providing reproducible images.\n\n\nSingularity requires sudo privileges to build an image of container.\n\n\nSingularity has its own image format, but it can also load images from Docker registries.\n\n\nDocker images are stored off in the local image cache, and you are expected to interact with them using the docker image command. In contrast, Singularity images are just normal files on your filesystem that you can move and execute as you want.\n\n\nDocker has a bigger ecosystem than Singularity: it has Mac and Windows integration, lots and lots of tools support it. Singularity is a less popular tool, with for example beta Mac support but no Windows support at the moment.\n\n\nHowever Docker (such as Windows and Mac) is a private corporation product while Singularity is a libre software. So even if Docker is distributed as a freeware with few restrictions, it may change over time. So if you are working for a public research lab it is better to favor a libre solution. Taxpayers' money should not be used to serve private interests when an equivalent solution is available for free.\n\n\nReferences\n\nFormation MESO@LR: reproductibility with container (Gino Frazzoli)\n\n","id":"https://guerinpe.com/articles/virtual-environment-reproducibility/","title":"Virtual Environments, Containers and Scientific Reproducibility"},"https://guerinpe.com/articles/what-is-a-bad-programmer/":{"body":"Coding refers to the act of writing instructions in a programming language. In that sense, the coder is also a programmer. The program must serve a clear purpose: automating a routine task, performing repetitive or complex calculations, managing data, and so on. In bioinformatics, programs are designed to transform raw biological data into formats that can be used by other specialists for further analysis.\n\nThe program is not a static code but a living thing. The environment around it can evolve, requirements may change, and the program must adapt accordingly to remain useful. Therefore, the code has to be modified and tested by anyone as often as needed.\nThe code is ambivalent:\n\nSequence of instructions that is run by the computer.\nText that must be easy to read.\n\nBest coding practices have been introduced to improve code readability (by other humans) and, consequently, ease program maintenance. In this context, bad or good code is, above all, code that either jeopardizes or saves the life of the program.\nWhat is a bad code?\n\nDoes not do its job!\nDifficult to change.\n\nReciprocally, a good code\n\nWorks!\nIs easy to change.\n\nTherefore, what does a good programmer?\n\nSpends few time refactoring their code.\nWrites new features.\n\nUnreadable code\n\nA good code is comprehensible by anyone.\nA good code is structured into modules.

Musicians often develop a way of thinking that is close to the logic used in science or engineering. Examples of scientists who are also musicians and reciprocally are numerous: Albert Einstein, physicist and violonist; Bruce Dickinson, lead singer of Iron Maiden and airline pilot; Brian May lead guitarist of Queen and astrophysicist; Bryan Holland, guitarist of The Offspring, who holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology.\nLast but not least, Steve Jobs shown how collaborative skills in a rock band can be applied to teams that develop high tech products.\n\nDuring my journey as a student in Paris University, I was part of several rock bands and played on stage in various nightclubs, weddings and business school galas. My career in Bioinformatics is more and more demanding in both time and effort, so I must now let go my passion for music. I have been a musician since the age of four, and after spending so much years playing in rock bands, I feel like I reached the end of my career as a musician.\nHere are the lessons rock bands taught me about people and collaboration.\n\nEarly Years\nI studied piano and music theory in the conservatoire for five years. After the conservatoire, I specialized in jazz piano and the art of improvisation for one year. One summer in the countryside, a friend introduced me to the guitar, We were obsessed by Nirvana, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gorillaz. I continued playing piano exploring blues and jazz scores by Tom Waits and John Coltrane. Finally, an older pianist friend taught me about bal musette and how to play pop songs on the synthesizer.\nBy high school, I started playing in rock band, performing covers of heavy metal and rock bands such as Radiohead, Muse, and Metallica. I progressively gave up piano to learn guitar and bass instead.\nParisian Nights on Stage\nWhile being a student in Paris, I was first obsessed by scores from Megadeth and founded an heavy metal band aiming to make original songs inspired by Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman. After a year of hard work, we had built enough of an audience to perform our first concerts, playing both our own compositions and covers of other heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.\nUnfortunately, the band had to split due to the different life paths of its members. The alchemy we had was difficult to recreate with others, so I gave up on forming a new band.\nI realized how much I enjoyed being on stage and decided to follow the path of least resistance at this time: I accepted any offers from rock or pop bands looking for a bassist.\nFrom there, everything was easy:\nRehearsals\nMany schools and associations provide free rooms and instruments for students to practice. The cost is often very cheap, especially for students.\nConcerts\n\nThey are associations that link nightclubs and bands. Back in 1960s, Auvergnat and Kabyle clubs were well known for having hosted some of the first rockabilly bands in Paris. Today, they continue this tradition by supporting underground music. Each band brings its own audience, which helps the nightclub attract customers. Materials like amps and drum kits are usually provided by the association. Sometimes, you have to share with other bands of different styles such as RNB, rap, or electro.\nBusiness schools frequently organize galas and parties. I was always surprised by how business schools are supportive to music and culture.\nOpen jam sessions offer free spaces where anyone can bring their instrument and play for a public audience. These sessions are open to all, encouraging improvisations and battles. Like the soccer field at sunday, it is hogged by the old regulars.\nAfter a concert, people from the audience may offer an opportunity to play at weddings or other private events.\n\nNetworking with Other Musicians\nThey are specialized websites and forums like zikinf to connect musicians. They are useful to find bands or fill missing positions. Over time, as I become part of the little parisian community, people start reaching out directly just because they know me.\nFinding an Audience\nWord of Mouth\nNightclubs usually excepts 50-70 people. Most nightclubs in Paris are very small, so 20 people make the place look occupied, while overcrowded with 50 people. For some reasons people wandering in the streets are attracted by overcrowded nightclubs. So 50 people can easily turn into 100 by the end of the evening. In addition, concerts make people stay instead of just having one drink.\nWhen you group yourself with three other bands. If each band brings 20 people, 20 × 4 = 80 people. Already good enough, and the nightclub might expect more visitors over the evening.\nAs a band is composed of 5 members, if each member brings at least 4 persons (which is easy), we got the 20 persons per band necessary to a full audience. In addition, the association or friends can bring extra people.\nSo far, Facebook and social networks have never brought anyone to an event who was not already invited by someone IRL. We use Facebook like posters: it does not really help, but it makes the event looks more official.\nEven with an audience, you will convert less than 1% into real fans. So at a typical concert with 100 people, you might only gain one new fan. Because most people come to see their friends and have a good time, not specifically for the music. And the worst part is your fan are often the type of people who do not use Facebook at all! So you have to text them personally to keep them in the loop.\nBut even then, even by playing very well, being talented, and performing many concerts for years in a row, I think there is a glass ceiling in Paris. I mean a maximum number of fans for rock music. Nevertheless, you are more famous than the number of your fans would suggest. People who don't attend your concerts may have already heard of your band by their friends.\nCompetitions and Showcases\nThe magazine Rock &amp; Folk, led by Philippe Manoeuvre, often organized showcase competitions to help new bands get noticed. The advantage of these events is that they take place in larger places, such as the Gibus club. The competition was decided by audience votes. The band with the most fans win a recording session and exposure.\nBut even then, winners were bands like BB Brunes, The Naast or Plastiscines. While in London, it was Artic Monkeys and Kasabian who emerged. The gap in exposure between Paris and London is abyssal.\nMaking a band\nA rock band is a group of gentlemen who come together to play covers or original compositions on stage.\nThe type of musicians\nFor fun I made caricatures of the different types of musicians based on people I have met. Each character is defined by an obsession: expression, composition, sound setup, interpretation, stage presence.\n🧑‍🚀 The Gifted\n\nStrenghts: Genius in improvisation, finds ideas from outer space.\nFlaws: Chaotic, hard to repeat, does not communicate well.\n\n👷 The Builder\n\nStrengths: Gives structure to songs, organizes the band, creative composer.\nFlaws: Can be rigid as he insists on sticking to his \"vision\", lacks feeling and groove.\n\n🧑‍🍳 The Colorist\n\nStrengths: Seeking for new sounds, instruments, effects and tone.\nFlaws: Less focus on interpretation, can get lost in gear, perfectionist with setups.\n\n🧙 The Purist\n\nStrengths: Perfectionist, disciplined, technically strong, plays with feeling and groove.\nFlaws: Not very inventive, conservative, eternal student mindset.\n\n🧑‍🚒 The Lover\n\nStrengths: Charismatic, magnetic on stage, brings mystery and coolness.\nFlaws: Weak technician, more about the show than the music, sometimes a poser.\n\nSynergy\nThe beauty of a team is that while individuals may have flaws, when they come together, those flaws can turn into strengths for the group.\n\n🧑‍🚀 🧙 The Gifted and the Purist: The Purist will be amazed by the Gifted's playing. He will work hard to figure out how the Gifted does it and then explain it to the rest of the group. Symetrically, the Purist, who is usually reluctant to play on stage because \"not ready yet\" is reassured by the Gifted's virtuosity.\n🧑‍🍳 🧑‍🚒 The Colorist and the Lover: The Lover is not the creative kind. But he will pick the easy flashy ideas from his friend the Colorist to bring some crazy momentum to the show. While the Colorist does not really knows which of his ideas can touch the audience, the Lover will do. Symetrically without the Colorist, the Lover will not have such original ideas to improve the show.\n👷 👷 Two Builders: Composition is vast and a composer is rarely good at everything. For example, it helps to have one specialist for the rhythmic parts and another one for harmonies.\n\nThe Alchemy\nAggregating Ideas\nNo one ever brings a finished song. That is why a band tends to be collegial and not dictatorial because it is not possible to make a good song without the full engagement of everyone in the process of creation.\nGenerally, everyone bring an idea: it can be a cool riff, a nice structure, a nice chord progression, a melody, a theme, a new instrument, a weird way to use a tone freak, or just a feeling to express, whatever! The other members will then add their own ideas or recall ideas previously discussed during other rehearsals.\n\nWhy do we not combine the riff of X with the melody of Y using the sound effect of Z? Mhm I'm not sure. Z do you have something else that could suit more with the theme of the song?\n\nAggregating everyone's ideas is a long process. There are usually dozens of songs under construction, and some elements are often still missing to make a piece feel complete. Then, often over a drink, spending good times together someone got the spark, the missing piece that finish the song. I remember being on the train, having the epiphany, so excited that I called my guitarist friend and sang him the notes to play on the phone. And he was like \"You found it! You're a genius!\". Everyone on the train stared at me as if I were mad. Music and his creative process are somewhat captivating.\nBalancing Egos\nEveryone in the band is taking great pride of her musician skills and even more of his ideas. Rejecting someone's idea can hurt her feelings, and they might want to leave the band or even sabotage the collective work.\nHow to select good ideas without hurting people?\nFirst, being good friends and spending enjoyable time together makes it easier to be honest and direct. If an idea is bad, I won’t lie to my friend. This help to fasten ideas selection. The downside is that when the same people's ideas are always accepted while others are always rejected. It creates resentment.\nThis is why we use \"the bag of ideas\". All ideas that aren't bad go into the bag so they can be used later. Ideas are used like bricks that can be assembled into different songs. It is hard to predict what will make a good song, so it is better if everyone has fun and feels contributing. In the end, the audience decides which song works best. Because we always involve everyone, no one takes it personally. It is not the song of X versus the song of Y. It is the song of the band.\nBe Pragmatical\nDespite we are all friends and so on. It is important to keep in mind the goal: to play on stage and be ready. If a member did not show up for rehearsals, struggled technically without making progress, stole belongings  or created a negative vibe, then we had no choice but to split the band.\nSpending a lot of time Together\nTo achieve a high level of musical synchronization, you need to be very familiar with each other. This comes naturally, through imprinting, imitation, and rehearsals. You really have to spend a lot of time together. This is why it helps to love each other. However, the reward of such dedication is fantastic: when you manage to play in perfect sync, you feel a kind of shared magic power that give chills. And the audience feels it as well.\nPlaying What you Love\nYou have to choose wisely the song you will work on together. If the band don't have goose bumps at the early stage you have to throw it away. Why? Because you will spend a lot of time playing over and over this song, revisiting the same passages, and polishing every detail. To sustain that effort with passion and precision, you need to love the song.\nBehavior is more important than Skills\nWhen I first started learning guitar, I also needed a bit of money. So, almost at the same time, I began giving guitar lessons. My students were usually just six months behind me in experience, but that was enough to make me the \"teacher\". When someone is less experienced, they can not say your true level.\nNow, imagine you are a guitarist and you need to recruit a drummer. You are in trouble, because you can not say the true level of the candidates. Every drummer you meet is more experienced on their instrument than you are.\n\nIn a band, one skilled musician is good enough. They are other roles. Scores can be adapted to match a musician's skill level.\nEnthusiasm matters. Do the candidate inspires the rest of the band?\nMotivation matters. Is the candidate ready to take the band all the way to the stage?\nReliability matters. Will the candidate show up on time for rehearsals?\nCharacter matters. Will the candidate improve the mood in the band?\nCreativity matters. Will the candidate proposes ideas, or stay passive?\nFlexibility matters. Can the candidate find solutions if a guitar is missing five minutes before going on stage?\nSociability matters. Will the candidate bring new fans to the band?\nThe big question. Will the candidate expand the spirit of the band or shrink it?\n\nLearning from each others\nWhile practicing your instrument, they are two way: the hard way and the easy way.\n\nThe hard way is what how you learn in a conservatoire. You repeat passages thousands of times until your fingers and brain are perfectly synchronized, reaching perfect execution.\nThe easy way is what you learn from other musicians.There are many shortcuts and tricks that produce the same effect with minimal effort. These tricks are usually discovered by those who have gone through the hard way, so by learning from your peers, you can spare yourself a lot of hard work.\n\nHaving an Outside Observer\nAs far as I remember, there was always at least one person watching our rehearsals. Often it was friends or members of other bands or just the guardian of the local. Their presence added a little pressure, helping us get used to play in front of an audience.\nIt also kept arguments in checkmate. Disagreements quickly turned into jokes, saving a lot of time. Rehearsals are short, and every minute counts.\nWe could also get feedback: whether an influence was too noticable in a composition; whether the sound balance was right or wether the suggestion from X or Y was relevant or not. Finally when our friends said \"This rocks!\" after a final play, it was pure joy.\nBuilding Trust\nGoing on stage is intimidating. The fear of failing yourself, the fear of letting your friends down, the fear of being let down by them. I have realized that when everything is shared equally within the band, there is very little stress before a performance.\nOn the contrary, in a more hierarchical band, with a leader at the top, fear is everywhere. The leader is anxious because, he is carrying the weight of the band. The other members are anxious because of the leader being anxious. The audience feels something is off.\nTrust comes from sharing.\nHaving Fun\nTo be honest, we spent so much time stressing over small things without interest that if we had taken ourselves too seriously, the whole experience would have felt sinister.\nOf course, we still had to be on time for rehearsals and organize concerts, which required a certain level of seriousness. But I think the reason we managed to play on stage despite not being perfect was the good vibes. Creativity is impossible without being relaxed. Working with people you love and having fun clearly fosters inspiration. I can not count the number of times I got spark of ideas just after a good laugh.\nConclusion\nI learned from my friends to do not worry and to live fully in the moment. Music is something alive. Collaboration is not about forcing a rational consensus. It is about feeling good with people, appreciating them, and understanding their flaws, strengths and most important what makes them extraordinary.\nMusic taught me to combine open-mindedness with practical common sense: being flexible, tolerant of differences and free from preconceptions. Finally, playing with soul is only what matters.\n","id":"https://guerinpe.com/articles/what-playing-in-rock-bands-taught-me-about-collaboration/","title":"What Playing in Rock Bands Taught Me About Collaboration"},"https://guerinpe.com/publications/":{"body":"\nPublications on ORCiD\nPublications on ResearchGate\nPublications on Google Scholar\n\nScientific articles\n\nThe distribution of coastal fish eDNA sequences in the Anthropocene\nLaetitia Mathon, Virginie Marques, Stéphanie Manel, Camille Albouy, Marco Andrello, Emilie Boulanger, Julie Deter, Régis Hocdé, Fabien Leprieur, Tom B Letessier, Nicolas Loiseau, Eva Maire, Alice Valentini, Laurent Vigliola, Florian Baletaud, Sandra Bessudo, Tony Dejean, Nadia Faure, Pierre‐edouard Guerin, Meret Jucker, Jean‐baptiste Juhel, Kadarusman, Andrea Polanco F, Laurent Pouyaud, Dario Schwörer, Kirsten F Thompson, Marc Troussellier, Hagi Yulia Sugeha, Laure Velez, Xiaowei Zhang, Wenjun Zhong, Loïc Pellissier, David Mouillot\nGlobal Ecology and Biogeography. 2023 August 08.
