<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I design tools to analyze <a href="{{ get_url(path='activity') }}">omics data</a>. That means turning complex biological information into actionable insights with automation, reproducibility, and scalability in mind. 
I have a broad interest in applying computational approaches to solve biological problems. Before working in industry, I contributed to research projects for fisheries and marine biology at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bev/1048-desc/3594-pierre-edouard-guerin">CNRS</a>. 
I have been fortunate to collaborate on several <a href="{{ get_url(path='publications') }}">publications</a>.
