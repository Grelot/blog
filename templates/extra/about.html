<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am a bioinformatician research scientist based in France currently working at the <a href="https://www.florimond-desprez.fr/">Florimond Desprez Group</a>.  
I contribute to the Research Unit, supporting crop breeders in making faster and more informed decisions.</p>


<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I design tools to analyze <a href="{{ get_url(path='activity') }}">omics data</a>. That means turning complex biological information into actionable insights with automation, reproducibility, and scalability in mind. 
I care a lot about making data workflows that do not just work, but last. 
My background bridges computer science and life sciences, and I have a broad interest in applying computational approaches to biological questions. Before working in industry, I contributed to population genomics studies for fisheries and marine biology at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bev/1048-desc/3594-pierre-edouard-guerin">CNRS</a>.  
I have been fortunate to collaborate on a number of <a href="{{ get_url(path='publications') }}">scientific publications</a>.
