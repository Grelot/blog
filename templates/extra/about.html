<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am a bioinformatician based in France. I work at the <a href="https://www.florimond-desprez.fr/">Florimond Desprez Group</a>.

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I develop biotools to help breeders improve the genetics of crops. My work includes identifying genetic markers associated with traits of interest and predicting their resistance to biotic or abiotic stress using technologies such as DNA microarray, mass spectrometry and <a href="{{ get_url(path='activity') }}">omics</a>. 
Before working in industry, I contributed to research projects in fisheries and conservation biology at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bev/1048-desc/3594-pierre-edouard-guerin">CNRS</a>. 
I have collaborated on a number of <a href="{{ get_url(path='publications') }}">publications</a>.
