<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am a bioinformatician based in France. I work at the <a href="https://www.florimond-desprez.fr/">Florimond Desprez Group</a>.  
</p>


<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I develop computational solutions to support breeders in their work, for instance identifying genetic markers in plants or predicting their resistance to pests using technologies such as DNA microarray, mass spectrometry and <a href="{{ get_url(path='activity') }}">omics</a>. 
Before working in industry, I contributed to research projects in fisheries and conservation biology at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bev/1048-desc/3594-pierre-edouard-guerin">CNRS</a>. 
I have been fortunate to collaborate on several <a href="{{ get_url(path='publications') }}">publications</a>.
