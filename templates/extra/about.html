<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am a bioinformatician currently working at the <a href="https://www.florimond-desprez.fr/">Florimond Desprez Group</a>.  
I bring my expertise to the Research Unit, enabling crop breeders to make faster and more informed decisions.</p>


<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I develop computational solutions for agronomy applications, for instance identifying genetic markers in plants or predicting their resistance profiles using technologies such as next-generation sequencing, DNA chips, mass spectrometry and <a href="{{ get_url(path='activity') }}">omics data</a>. 
Before working in industry, I contributed to research projects in fisheries and conservation biology at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bev/1048-desc/3594-pierre-edouard-guerin">CNRS</a>. 
I have been fortunate to collaborate on several <a href="{{ get_url(path='publications') }}">publications</a>.

<h2>Why this blog?</h2>

This is where I stash notes, lessons and practical knowledge picked up along the way. Good reading!
