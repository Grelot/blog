<p>
I have long been interested by the application of computer science to biology.
</p>

<p>
In 2014, under the supervision of Dr. Yassine GHOUZAM and Dr. Jean-Christophe GELLY, my initiation focused on the modeling of the structures of living molecules such as blood proteins.
</p>

I then became interested in algorithms and methods for processing high-throughput DNA sequencing data. I worked for medical research of diabetes under the direction of Dr. Anne PHILIPPI and Dr. Cecile JULIER to sharpen my skills.
</p>

<p>
In 2017, I joined CNRS as a bioinformatician. During 5 years, under the direction of Dr. Stephanie MANEL, I collaborated in many European projects focusing on fish stock assessment and management.

<p>
In 2021, I joined Florimond Desprez group. Under the direction of Dr. Bruno Desprez, I develop tools to help breeders better understand the genetic background of plants. Such tools process genetic data (NGS, DNAchip) or work on further analysis crossing genetic information with phenotype and field conditions.
