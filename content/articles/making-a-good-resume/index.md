The resume is the first thing the recruiter will read about you. I revised my resume multiple times already and continue to sharpen it. Here I describe the structure and overall basics tips to make a competitive resume.
<!-- more -->

## Structure and Basics

* Contact information (mail, phone).
* Content is king.
* Never lie. Exaggerating a little is fine.
* Four sections:
  1. Education 
  2. Experience
  3. Skills
  4. Others

## 1. Education section

* Quick summary
* Not a student: checkbox rather than highlight

## 2. Experience section

* Core of your resume
* Chronologically organized
* legal job title, company, time, date
* If the company activity is not well known, add a one line description of it
* The most recent job experience must have the most bullet points

### How to write good bullets

* Tell a story in your bullet (Begin, Middle, End)
* What was the problem/opportunity?
  - Begin bullet with the following words: `analysed` `discovered` `investigated` `tackled` `initiated` `founded` `defined` `advised`
* How did you fix it?
  - Middle bullet: `secured` `cultivated` `built` `designed` `unified` `revamped` `launched` `engineered`
* What did you do that went above and beyond?
* What was the **impact** and **results**?
  - End bullet: `awarded` `earned` `reached` `succeed` `demonstrated` `completed` `boosted` `generated` `improved`

</div>


**DON'T EXPLAIN WHAT THE COMPANY/LAB DOES !** Instead, focus on your **impact** and **results**. Whenever possible, use numbers to highlight the impact of your work.

### How do I show impact ?

* As much as possible should have a number behind it
* This shows scale of your projects.
  - How many team members?
  - How many did this increase revenue?
  - How many partners/customers?
  - How many articles did you write?
  - How many students did you teach?
  - How much did the company or labs grow because of your work?

## 3. Skills section

* Skills is an optionnal section
* Avoid *soft skills*
* List sorted from the most known skill to the least known skill to the right

## 4. Miscellaneous section

* One or two lines maximum
* Just to give some flesh to your personnality :)
