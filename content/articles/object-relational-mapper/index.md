In bioinformatics, we are familiar with Python and SQL. Python is a general coding language used to problem solve and create programs. SQL is a specific language used to store and retrieve specific information from databases. Then you have SQLAlchemy which is the bridge between both languages. This presents a method to use Python to create databases and facilitates the communication between Python programs and the databases. 

**Object Relational Mapper (ORM)** tool translates Python classes to tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements.
