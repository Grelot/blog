**Genomics** is the study of the whole DNA sequences of an organism. **Next-generation Sequencing (NGS)**, particularly Illumina sequencing, have transformed DNA sequencing by allowing millions of fragments to be sequenced in parallel, dramatically increasing speed and reducing cost. High-throughput DNA sequencing has become essential for applications such as whole-genome sequencing, targeted resequencing, and variant discovery
