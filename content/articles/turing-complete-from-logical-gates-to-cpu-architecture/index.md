In 2021, LevelHead published [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game), a game about computer science. My friend **Christophe Georgescu** recommended me to play it. Unfortunately, I took his advice and now I can not stop to play this game! The game challenges you to design an entire computer from scratch. You start with basic logic gates, then move on to components, memory, CPU architecture, and finally assembly programming. By the way, the game is neat and present all these concepts in a playful and intuitive way.
