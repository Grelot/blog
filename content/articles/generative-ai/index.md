## Introduction

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology aimed at mimicking human abilities like reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and perception.
    * **Machine Learning (ML)**: Uses algorithms and statistical models to execute tasks based on pattern recognition and inference, without explicit instructions.
    * **Statistics:** The foundational science for analyzing and interpreting data, essential for AI development.
    * **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that utilizes layered neural networks, excelling in complex tasks such as speech and image recognition.
    * **Generative AI**: Focuses on creating new content (e.g., images, texts, sounds) from trained data, emphasizing the versatility in output types.

### Process of Tokenizing and Embedding

* **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units called tokens *e.g.* words.
* **Embedding**: Converts tokens into numerical vectors that represent both the literal and contextual meanings of the tokens. This process is critical for machine understanding and manipulation of language.


### Applications and Developments in Generative AI

* **Prompt Engineering**: Often referred to as prompt hacking, it involves crafting queries that guide AI to produce desired outcomes. Used in various applications from grant proposals to blog posts and image generation.
* **Data Analytics and Application Integration**: LLMs can be integrated with APIs like OpenWeather for real-time data processing and activity suggestions based on weather conditions.
* **Automated Document Processing**: Tools like Langchain and ChatGPT can process and generate structured outputs from documents such as scientific papers.
