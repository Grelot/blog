The **Research Activities Tax Credit** is a tax credit that incentivizes businesses and organizations to increase their research and development.  Within my company, I have been tasked with writing the **Research Tax Credit (CIR) justification report** for France. Here, the method for writing such a report.

## Plan

1. List of R&D operations
2. Identity card of operation
3. Context and Objectives of R&D operation
4. Research Indicators
5. Object of the R&D operation
6. Scientific, technical or technological contribution
7. Description of the method & results
8. Human resources
9. Scientific partnership
10. List of documents related to the R&D operation

## List of R&D operations

Presentation of our R&D work must be decomposed into **operations**. An operation is part of a [project](/articles/project-report). The operation can be part of more than one single project and reciprocally a project may consist of several operations.

The operation aims to answer a scientific question. Its purpose is about **solving a bottleneck**. For the current year, you list all operations by project in a recapitulative table with the following columns:
* Name of the operation
* Year
* Span
* Contact person
* Class of the operation
  * `secret defense`, `confidential`, `restricted`
* Field
  * `A4c – Bioinformatique : inférence et analyse de séquences/réseaux, stockage et fouille, modélisation et simulation`
* Cost
* Short summary
  * Sentence 1: context
  * Sentence 2-3: identified bottleneck and objectives
  * Sentence 4-5: Completed objectives and results
* Research Indicator:
  * Scientific publications and communications
  * Collaboration with academia such as thesis, CIFRE contract and project (FUI, ANR, etc)
  * Patents

## 2. Identity card

Short description of the operation:
* Name of the operation
* Year
* Planned start and end
* Number of worked hours
* Field
  * `A4c – Bioinformatique : inférence et analyse de séquences/réseaux, stockage et fouille, modélisation et simulation`


## 3. Context and Objectives of the operation

3.1. Introduction: industrial and scientific context.
3.2. Prerequisites to understand the bottleneck.
3.3. Description of the technical bottleneck. Why do we initiate a work to solve it?
3.4. Planned objectives to solve this bottleneck.


## 4. Research Indicators

* Scientific publications and communications
* Collaboration with academia such as thesis, CIFRE contract and project (FUI, ANR, etc)
* Patents

## 5. Object of the operation

### 5.1. State of the art, Initial situation

* Complete description of the context in which occurs the bottleneck.
* Complete description of the bottleneck and [the state of the scientific community and knowledge about it](/articles/state-of-the-art).
* Complete description of the current state of the company and partners with regard to this bottleneck.
* Use scientific sources

### 5.2. Bottlenecks

List of bottlenecks from section `3.3.`
* Complete description of the the technical problems that we must solve.
* Justify that the problem is not already solved in the literature.
* Use scientific sources

### 5.3. References

Cite sources in the text whenever you refers to a [scientific article](/articles/scientific-article), ideas, or words. The citation format depends on the chosen style (APA, MLA, Chicago, or Vancouver).


## 6. Scientific, technical or technological contribution

Describe the knowledge or how-to produced by the operation. Precise the delivered innovation in regard to the state of the art. Demonstrate why the produced materials are innovative.

### 6.1. Results

Answer for each bottlenecks in section `5.2.`:
* What does the result?
* What is **innovative** in it?

### 6.2. Bilan

Summary of all bottlenecks and solutions/results provided to solve each of them.

## 7. Description of the method & results

* Description of the method for each results listed in sections `6.1.` and `6.2.`
  * Initial work hypothesis
  * Used tools and softwares
  * Materials such as figures and table to demonstrate the **technicity** of your method
* Discussion of the results
  * Show the [**reproductibility**](/articles/virtual-environment-reproducibility/) of the results
  * Analysis and conclusion of each result
* [Gantt diagram](http://127.0.0.1:1111/articles/gantt-chart-excel-for-project-management/)
  * Show the **chronology** of the works
  * Pluriannual planning of the project

## 8. Human resources

* List involved persons in the operation
* Justify case of low percent (0-10%) of participation of the person
* Justify case of high percent (90-100%) of participation of the person

## 9. Scientific partnership

* List of partnerships and contractors involved in the operation
  * process of selection of the partner or contractor
  * description of the contribution
* For each partnership:
  * Object of the sub-operation
  * Scientific, technical or technological contribution
  * Description of the method & results
* Which works are funded by the Research Tax Credit and which works are not funded.


## 10. List of documents related to the operation

* Documents that justify research indicators:
  * Scientific publications and communications
  * Collaboration with academia such as thesis, CIFRE contract and project (FUI, ANR, etc)
  * Patents
* Supplementary materials and figures related to the description of the method & results
