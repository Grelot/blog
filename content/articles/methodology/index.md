One of the most promising genetic techniques for improving biodiversity assessments is the *metabarcoding* of environmental DNA (eDNA). I did a state of the Art of available methods and developed serveral workflows to process and manage metabarcoding data from the Monaco Marine Scientific Exploration.

Lola Romant has made a beautiful documentary about marine eDNA metabarcoding methods and their applications in the Mediterranean sea.
