When I was in junior high school, I had the opportunity to take History and Geography classes with Professor Ben Fredj. Moreover, he taught us methodology and how to compose and articulate our thoughts and knowledge. I recently watched a MOOC he recorded for Lycée français international Louis-Massignon in Casablanca, Morroco. Although his methodology course focuses on social sciences, I believe most of his lessons are fundamental and valuable for anyone, particularly in academia or industry.
