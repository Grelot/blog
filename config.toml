introduction = """I am a computer scientist at CNRS of Montpellier. 
 I am mainly focusing on second and third Next-Generation Sequencing data analysis for the european project RESERVEBENEFIT.
  I am also strongly involved in environmental DNA data based studies such as MONACO MARINE WORLDWIDE EXPEDITION.
  My expertise is related to programming, LINUX systems, data vizualisation, whole-genome assembly, 3D protein modelling, population genomics, 
     parsing large public database and machine learning. I am interested in working on next-generation approaches 
    and solving complex problems using combination of state-of-the-art algorithms."""
